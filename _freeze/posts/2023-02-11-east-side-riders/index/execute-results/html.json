Earth date 02/11/2023, but it took me a while to write the Captain's Log.\n\n![Flyer for this ride; I'm not the only person calling bike rides \"voyages\".](esr-2023-02-11.jpg){width=60%}\n\n\"I probably can't make it,\" I said to myself, as I just snoozed for 20 minutes. Now I'm blessed with flexible work schedule, but if I keep on living this way, then I'll be doomed once I lose this flexibility after I graduate. I kept on getting up too late, until I need to yank myself out of bed to either conform to an earlier social schedule of events or maximize daylight time for a voyage. Because without [Frozen Turkey](https://getcoldturkey.com/features/), I often have trouble stopping what I'm doing, ending up staying up. Wilmington is kind of far from Pasadena. Taking into account traffic lights and the slow and chaotic part of DTLA, it would realistically take me about 1 and a half hours to ride hard and fast to cover the 21 miles to get to Wilmington, where this family friendly [East Side Rider](https://esrbc.org/) ride took place. I only had less than 1:15 left. Anyway, if I still feel tired, then I'll go elsewhere, like re\\_ grocery first and then Monrovia. Or worst case scenario, they leave without me, and I'll just continue on my own adventure, to check out some murals and interesting places on Central Ave that I blew past last time in CicLAvia last December. Or perhaps, just like the Tour de North Carson last March, I rode hard but still arrived 2 minutes late, only to find out that they wouldn't roll until half an hour later, so I had quite a bit of time to kill, talking to other riders.\n\n<div class=\"strava-embed-placeholder\" data-embed-type=\"activity\" data-embed-id=\"8545943541\"></div><script src=\"https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js\"></script>\n\nThe slow part of DTLA began, slow because of frequent stops, from traffic lights, and because cars and shared scooters not being ridden often block the bike lane. My usual route through DTLA takes the N Spring St bike lane. The part of Spring St by the LA City Hall was closed, for an Iranian protest, presumably against the official celebration of the 44th anniversary of the Iranian \"Islamic\" Republic. The protest hadn't started yet. But Boo! Lots of Iranian Imperial flags. Maybe monarchists there. Death to monarchy, and death to all forms of authoritarianism! Anyway, I was running late. No time to take photos or to talk to people. While the road was closed, I could ride on the sidewalk, just more slowly. Meanwhile -- not to downplay the atrocities committed by the blasphemous Iranian government -- I wonder, on January 21, why couldn't we close the road when we protested against the [death of 312 people from traffic violence in LA City in 2022](https://www.streetsareforeveryone.org/blog/dying-on-the-streets-of-los-angeles), which was overshadowed by the Monterey Park shooting that night in the news? Why couldn't we close the road to protest against climate suicide as the car and fossil fuel industries resist climate action? Even many progressives don't question car culture.\n\n![Streets Are For Everyone (SAFE) die in on January 21, 2023, photo from BikinginLA. I'm the person next to the Grim Reaper and beneath the Vision Zero is Dying sign, holding the Cars Kill Chidren sign. Senator Portantino is at the lower right corner, in white and red. I talked to the person in the Grim Reaper costume. She has lived in LA for 7 years without a car. There's the claim that most residential areas in LA are mostly flat, and with the nice weather, there's no excuse for LA not to be a bike mecca. I think from my personal experience, the mostly flat claim is mosty true, but I need to do a formal analysis to see how true it is.](Die-in-11.jpeg)\n\nInitially I planned to take a detour at 52nd street and Avalon Blvd to see the murals at Dr. Maya Angelou Community High School (where the \"Hate has caused a lot of problems...\" comes from) on the way to Wilmington, but decided to go there on the way back instead because I was running late and my traffic light luck wasn't great. There were many murals and walls full of graffiti in this region. Having been fascinated with graffiti since 2008 due to my first trip to LA, I put these graffiti walls in Highland Park in my Hall of Fame, but there were too many here for me to keep track. While it's nice to have a protected bike lane, it's annoying when it's often blocked by cars (now I need to dodge the bollards) and when there's more trash and potentially flat causing debris in the bike lane. I passed several cyclists, most likely local, riding cheap mountain or commuter bikes, often riding on the sidewalk, a very different culture from that of the rich middle aged men in Lycra (MAMILs). I wonder what those cyclists thought when I passed them. While I don't really feel like I fit in the MAMIL culture, I certainly did dress the MAMIL way, adjusted for gender and age. It was cold, but I rode hard enough to work up a sweat.\n\nFinally, left turn at 120th St. I just rode over 120 blocks! Somehow that sounded impressive. Actually more than 120, because there are streets with the same number but different suffices, such as 52nd St and 52nd Pl. Here's [an imperfect explanation for the duplicates](https://laist.com/news/transportation/los-angeles-la-street-names-duplicate-avenue-drive-place-explain). I was at least 15 minutes late. I was right. When I got to Central Ave, I saw a bunch of cyclists at the parking lot at the East Side Riders bike shop and co-op, haven't departed yet. This is a family friendly ride, not meant for speed craving road warriors. But everyone was welcome. This shop really likes fat-tired lowrider bikes. It also sold skates, which I also see used in CicLAvia. I also saw cruiser style e-bikes, and two Razor mini electric motorcycles without pedals. Nor was I the only roadiot there. There was at least one recent model road bike, and a few vintage ones. \n\n![Lowrider and cruiser bikes at the ESR bike shop](P2110009.jpg)\n\n![The lowrider bike depicted on that high vis vest, and the skates](P2110010.jpg)\n\nWhile I enjoy the thrill of speed, I did not come here for speed. Rather, I came to learn about the culture of South LA, in solidarity with this working class neighborhood of color. True, there are more dangerous roads and gangs, but I tend to find poor neighborhoods more vibrant and edgy than rich ones and graffiti is part of it. It's precisely the edge that I like. A long term goal of the voyages is to learn about the different cultures of each region of LA, as well as different cycling cultures. The PAA is more like mostly MAMIL who drive to the ride culture, some road racing culture, and some sort of MAMIL roadie but not formally racing culture. Mountain and gravel cultures are present in PAA but I don't know much about them since I don't have a mountain or gravel bike, though I want one after I graduate. At the Carson velodrome, I got a taste of track racing culture, which is somewhat different from road racing culture, as some people I talked to there said they turned to track because they didn't feel safe riding on the road. I also experienced advocacy culture with BikeLA (formerly LACBC), Pasadena Complete Streets Coalition, Active SGV, CicLAvia, and Critical Mass, people who bike as transport and advocate for policies and infrastructure to make that easier and safer. There's also the bikepacking and touring culture, which I got a taste of when I met other bike tourists on Amtrak trains and when I stayed at Warmshower hosts in my solo tour of Mt Rainier in August 2022. But mostly, I'm in the intersection between the roadie and advocacy cultures, in that like roadies, I can ride much further and faster than most bike commuters and Voyager is a road racing bike, and roadies do at least somewhat value adventure and scenery although I go in far greater length to check out the nooks and crannies than most roadies, but meanwhile, without a car, I bike for commutes and errands and I'm more passionate about advocacy than most roadies.\n\nI came to this specific ride, in the advocacy culture, which I heard about from BikeLA's newsletter, because I admire the missions of East Side Riders (ESR), which started off handing out food to the less fortunate by bike and has improved bike safety in Watts so [\"gang members know not to bother folks on bikes\"](https://la.curbed.com/2016/4/13/11428342/watts-bike-lanes-east-side-riders), and [People for Mobility Justice](https://www.peopleformobilityjustice.org/), which advocates for active transport in poor neighborhoods of color. I'm fascinated with murals and there are many in South Central (some I visited in this trip); that started with People for Mobility Justice's [Eastside mural ride guide](https://www.peopleformobilityjustice.org/eastside-mural-ride-self-guided-1). These murals document community history that may not be told in \"official\" history written by those in power, and they continue to influence my life, especially the [\"We are NOT a Minority\" mural](https://www.themcla.org/murals/we-are-not-minority) at Estrada Courts on Olympic from the Chicano Moratorium, which gave me confidence and hope in the rebellious movements behind the thin veneer engineered by those in power to show the tourists.\n\nMost riders I saw were Black or Hispanic, but there were a few Asians and White riders. With my real camera, I could probably pass as the official photographer. I met two other guys with real cameras, at least one was the real official photographer, whose camera had a microphone attached to the hot shoe. He greeted me with a special sense of camaraderie as he saw me taking photos with my real camera. It turned out that I wasn't the one who came the furthest. One of the ride marshalls drove all the way from *Riverside*. Maybe not the best for the environment, but he grew up around Wilmington and misses the community there. LA is [losing Black people](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-09-29/gentrification-housing-homeless-supervisors-county-election), from gentrification of Black neighborhoods, pushing them to Antelope Valley and Inland Empire. \n\n![The Razor electric mini motorcycle. Earlier someone crashed it as it accelerated too quickly and she lost control.](P2110041.jpg)\n\nIt was almost 11 am. Finally ready to roll! It was so slow that I shifted to the small chain ring. Again, just like in Critical Mass, sometimes I would ride faster, getting way ahead of the \"peloton\", to take photos of them coming, or I may stop by the side to take photos from behind and later catch up. We took up an entire lane, with the confidence and courage from safety in numbers, mostly riding outside the bike lane, where it's only practical to ride single file. \n\n![A few announcements before we roll. Those are the Ride 4 Love sweater, with two bike wheels forming a heart shape.](P2110048.jpg)\n\n![We took up an entire lane, heading north on Central](P2110058.jpg)\n\nNot having the route, I didn't know the length of the ride, but I overheard someone saying about 12 miles. Riding 12 miles at this pace is no problem for me without refreshment, but we stopped a few times for refreshment and group photos, to cater to all fitness levels. Each rest stop was quite long, which I spent in part taking to other riders. \n\n![Lowrider at the first rest stop at the plaza around Central and 109th St, with public art](P2110069.jpg){width=60%}\n\n![Gathering for the first group photo](P2110071.jpg)\n\n![I looked elsewhere while others posed for the group photo](P2110078.jpg)\n\nThese are some riders I talked to: Jenny from West Hollywood, and Maru from southeast LA. Jenny is an art student from the fixie culture, who often rides with various groups in the edgy fixie culture. She likes fixies and single speed bikes because of their simplicity and the challenge to climb on too hard a gear. Also, these bikes tend to be cheap and less attractive to thieves. She biked up Griffith Park and Elysian Park hills on a single speed bike and knows a group that does the ride at 6:30 am on fixies. I have met a fixie group at the scenic turnout in Griffith Park at dusk, probably a different group. Impressive, as I used my small chain ring for the climb. At the Tour de North Carson ride, I also met some fixie riders, one wearing an aero time trial helmet and fascinated with track racing while also riding a fixie with high gear ratio on the road. \n\n![Riders I talked to while riding and at rest stops](P2110054.jpg)\n\nWe agree that South Central isn't very safe to ride in, despite the Avalon bike lane, because of aggressive drivers, probably aggressive because the road designed for speed [invites the aggression](https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/3853943-secretary-petes-safe-streets-plan-wont-succeed-if-engineers-continue-business-as-usual/). Poor neighborhoods of color are often turned into highways, leading to more dangerous roads and worse pollution. Here we have the wide and fast roads, Avalon, Central, Florence, El Segundo, Firestone, Century Blvd, Imperial Hwy, and etc. crisscrossing the neighborhood. In Santa Monica, Pasadena, and Boyle Heights, freeways have destroyed neighborhoods of color, while White neighborhoods were more likely to [fight off planned freeways](https://www.kcet.org/shows/lost-la/why-isnt-there-a-freeway-to-beverly-hills). How many highways are there in San Marino? Huntington Dr and Sierra Madre Blvd, and the part in San Marino isn't that bad, with a lot of greenery. No freeways. I should do a more formal analysis of length of freeways and multi lane highways with high speed limit in different regions of LA and how that relates to redlining.\n\nWe also both like Highland Park, for her a climb, for me mostly bombing down the hills but I have to climb on the way back. While I learnt to ride a fixie at the Carson velodrome, I would only ride one in the velodrome as I can't be sure to stop promptly at each intersection. What I learnt from the fixie is the track racing culture, which is very different from the urban fixie culture, such as that the track racers I met were overwhelmingly White while urban fixie riders I met tend to be more diverse, and that the urban fixie riders tend to show more of a rebellious vibe than track racers. However, from that Carson rider, there may be some overlap. I'm not sure if the [Bahati Foundation](https://www.bahatifoundation.org/) that grew out of Compton is relevant to the intersection. On city streets, I have also witnessed the BMX culture, but I have never participated in it so I don't know anything about it. See, I really think it would take years of research and a PhD thesis to write a book to comprehensively document all those different bike cultures in different regions of LA.\n\nMaru introduced me to the Pave Commute app which in theory has employers or sponsoring companies pay us for bike commutes. I signed up with the [CiBiC LA](https://cibic.bike/) group. I used the app a few times this week and got quite some \"coins\", but I don't yet know what I can use those coins for. It's supposed to match people with similar routes to form group to commute together. I haven't gotten a group yet, probably because I don't go to my office on a fixed schedule and the app caters more to regions adjacent to DTLA and Lincoln Heights though it allowed me to join from Pasadena. We exchanged phone numbers, if we wish to ride together or if we want to go to CicLAvia and Critical Mass.\n\nWatts isn't what I thought it is. We rode through a brand new posh and seemingly mostly uninhabited neighborhood around Century Blvd west of Alameda and we stopped at the Starbucks there, where I got some water. I still wonder what's the nature of this neighborhood. Whichever case, even if it's meant for gentrification, I see how it's absorbing the surrounding culture, such as the mural at Starbucks, a style I don't see in shopping centers targeting richer people in Pasadena, Glendale, Century City, and Beverly Hills. However, soon after, we saw much less posh Estrada Court style apartment complexes. \n\n![Starbucks mural](P2110084.jpg)\n\n![New posh neighborhood in Watts](P2110093.jpg)\n\n![Estrada Courts style buildings near the posh neighborhood](P2110094.jpg)\n\n![This is more typical of Watts, and see that lowrider in action](P2110108.jpg)\n\nNext stop was Watts Towers, which I have visited twice before, first after the Tour de North Carson, and then in CicLAvia last December. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](P2110114.jpg){width=768}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](P2110126.jpg){width=766}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nOur last rest stop was Willowbrooks/Rosa Parks transit center. The ride leader said we were behind schedule and would make a shortcut to go back to the bike shop. I don't know what the original plan was. Here Jenny took off, heading back to West Hollywood.\n\nBack at the bike shop. What did I learn? Well, that sounds too much like a school field trip and I'm too old for that. I did experience this community and culture and had fun. It's only once, so not in depth. The ESR holds a ride every month, and I may come back. Let the experience ferment and influence me in subtle and subconscious ways, and let this thread of experience be woven into my tapestry of worldview. I was hungry and asked the locals to recommend a restaurant. They recommended Mariscos Las Palmas on 120th St, which they go all the time. It specializes in seafood, but I saw some vegetarian options on their menu so I went. I ordered a veggie burrito, but when I started eating, I realized that I got fish, due to a misunderstanding. Anyway, I went vegetarian to reduce my carbon footprint and I don't claim that God absolutely forbids eating meat, so I didn't complain, especially that the fish burrito was really good.\n\n(photo of DTLA seen from Central)\n\nThen I began to head back north on Central Ave, to check out some cool places I blew past last December in CicLAvia. While Central isn't bike friendly, and true, it didn't feel good to ride on, it didn't feel too bad either. I stopped by Chuco's Justice Center at 76th St whose murals I greatly admire, one of which says \"Fight for your freedom\". \n\n(photo of Chuco)\n\nThen I made a detour west on 54th St to see the murals at Dr. Maya Angelou Community High School and another mural on [52nd St and Main](https://www.themcla.org/murals/beacon-hope) that I saw on the Mural Conservancy. \n\n(photos of the murals)\n\nThen I returned to Central and continued north, seeing more murals along the way. I then stopped by Jesus Bike Shop at 49th St, and a mural at 42nd St. That's a very different kind of bike shop from Incycle which caters to MAMILs. NIMBYs are full of nonsense. I can testify that I tend to see more cyclists in poor neighborhoods because bikes are much cheaper than cars and there are more bike shops there catering to the neighborhood. Further north on Central, Cyberpunk DTLA drew close. Cyberpunk indeed, of the high-tech, low life. There're the skyscrapers housing offices of powerful corporations and new luxury hotels and apartments. Yet I have seen people sleeping on the streets right beneath the skyscrapers. Skid Row is within walking distance away. This part of Central isn't that far, so the skyscrapers loom above this sketchy neighborhood, like in the [Neo-Tokyo song](https://scandroid.bandcamp.com/track/neo-tokyo-dance-with-the-dead-remix). \n\nI took the new 6th St bridge to go to Boyle Heights, to check out the Otomisan Restaurant, which signifies layers of history of the diverse Boyle Heights, where ethnic minorities who couldn't live elsewhere lived, though it's now mostly Latino. The layers of history I see in geographical space makes me wonder, in histological space, if RNA velocity uses unspliced mRNAs to give a glimpse into the future, then what can we use to get a glimpse into the past? There's lineage tracing, but would something endogenous to the cell tell something about its past?\n\n(photo of Otomisan)\n\nTo boldly go somewhere I have never gone before: East LA College (ELAC). Because of the continuity in vibe, often I have no idea when I cross neighborhood and city boundaries. I always thought that ELAC is in in unincorporated region of East LA, but it turns out that it's actually in Monterey Park. \n\n(ELAC photo)\n\nThe reason why I visited is that I was reading the book [Murales Rebeldes](https://muralesrebeldes.org/), which features a great mural by Roberto Chavez, [The Path to Knowledge and the False University](https://muralesrebeldes.org/enroll-in-chicano-studies-roberto-chavezs-1970s-mural-at-east-los-angeles-college/), that adorned the facade of the Rosco C. Ingalls Auditorium from 1974 to 1979 when it was whitewashed, disapproved by the administration, as the mural blended in cubist and surrealist styles, not always using typical Chicano styles and icons, and not imposing a single interpretation. Anothe mural depicting an uncontroversial history of Chicano murals is in the lobby of the auditorium, which I got a glimpse of.\n\n(auditorium photos)\n\nThen I climbed the Monterey Park hills back to the San Gabriel Valley (SGV). Geography shapes the demography and culture, as the hills (here) and rivers pose transportation challenges. The vibe changes very rapidly as the hill began, from Chicano to Chinese. Somewhat discrete spatial regions are real. Meanwhile, other spatial features, such as weather, change more continuously. To delineate spatial regions, it's really important to clarify the question asked to find these regions, and which features or variables are relevant and which are not. \n\nOn January 21, I dressed in all black for the Streets Are For Everyone die in, and passed through Monterey Park on the way back. I was already home by 10 pm, and then there was the mass shooting at Star Dance. It was Chinese New Year's Eve. Did I bring bad luck to the neighborhood because I should really dress in red while black is associated with death and is unlucky for this occasion? Maybe not. I don't really believe in luck, so any reference to it is figurative. I stopped by Star Dance on Garfield and Garvey. The site was still full of flowers, with a table with incense, in the Buddhist tradition. There were cards and pens to write notes. I wrote in Arabic and English, \"we are of God and to Him we return.\" I have good intentions, though in the back of my mind I wonder if some Islamophobe would misinterpret it. I also wonder if my act of taking photos would get misinterpreted, as photography is often not allowed in mausoleums. But if I make beautiful and artistic photos, then why not? Because it's beautiful, I don't find it disrespectful.\n\n(Star Dance photos)\n\nI have been to Alhambra many times, yet somehow I had never been to the Civic Center and the heart of Downtown. I passed by the City Hall, and the other dance studio, Lai Lai, where the shooter was disarmed by witnesses, was across the street from the City Hall. Many city halls have cool architecture (LA City, Pasadena, Downey, Compton, Glendale, and etc.), but I wasn't impressed by the one in Alhambra (or the one in San Marino, Montebello, Covina, Claremont, and etc.). In terms of architecture (not governance), my favorite city hall thus far is the one of Pasadena. But I like downtown Alhambra, again, the polished artisan vibe with lively modern businesses occupying historical buildings, those with 2 to 3 stories and Spanish revival, Art Deco, and vernacular styles so characteristic of LA. \n\n(photo)\n\nLast time I passed by a Mari Naomi Stop Anti-Asian Hate mural on Alhambra Rd around Electric Ave. This time I made sure to stop for a better look. It's the same content as the one at Garvey Park, Rosemead, but smaller and rearranged.\n\n(photo)\n\nBecause I stopped for photos quite often, dusk was drawing near, and the clouds were glowing in the golden hour. \n\n(photo from Huntington Dr and Garfield)\n\nLast place where I have never gone before: a part of Raymond Hill, where the Raymond Hotel used to be, which gave this hill and the road the name. The hotel caught fire from ember in 1895 and was rebuilt. Later it was eclipsed by the Huntington Hotel and the Great Depression spelled its doom. Historical photos of the first and second Raymond Hotel can be seen [here](https://waterandpower.org/museum/Early_Views_of_Pasadena_(Page_1).html#Raymond_Hotel). An apartment building on the hill bears a mural depicting the second Raymond Hotel.\n\n(Raymond Hill photo)\n\nAs the sun was setting, my trip was coming to a close. And thank you, Wayne Thom! I took inspiration from his [CNA Tower photo](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2021-02-16/wayne-thom-photographer-late-modern-1970s-architecture) with the building reflecting the cloud while the background is clear. Now the Art Center building on Raymond Ave was reflecting some clouds. It wasn't the most cloudy, so I can find a cloudier day and bring my tripod and see if I can get a better shot. \n\n(Art Center photo)\n\nFinally, is it true that \"hate has caused a lot of problems in the world, but has not solved one yet\"? I suppose, yes and no. Yes, because in our culture, \"hate\" often has a power dynamic, of a dominant group oppressing a less dominant one, and is often associated with discrimination based on certain characteristics. Oppression, inherently unjust, only causes problems and doesn't solve any. At a smaller scale, hate also often originates from egotistical envy and arrogance. No, because how about hating injustice and the system and institutions that perpetuate injustice? Certain things are justifiably hated, but nor is it pure hate, because we hate injustice because we love justice.\n",
