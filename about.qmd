Space, the current frontier, where "space" means geospatial as often assumed in spatial statistics. These are the voyages of the starship Voyager. Its ongoing mission, to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new views and new neighborhoods, to boldly go where Lambda has never gone before.

My name is Lambda, she/her. I live in Hahamongna, Tongva/Kizh/Gabrieleno territory, or in Anglo terms, Pasadena, Los Angeles (LA) County. One of my favorite aspects of LA is that there are many crazy people, crazy in cool ways. Hopefully I'm one of them. I'm a left-wing heterodox Muslim convert Aspie cultural rebel zero waster living in LA without a car for over 9 years. 

This blog is about Voyager. On the one hand, spatial -omics data analysis inspired by the geospatial tradition. On the other hand, the starship Voyager, which is my human powered ship that made me learn about the different cultures and landscapes of LA. Starship Voyager also made me think about spatial statistics and inspired many ideas in the R package Voyager project. This is the personal side of the "from geospatial to spatial -omics" on R package Voyager's documentation website.
