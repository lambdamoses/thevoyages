  abstract = "Skeletal muscle repair is driven by the coordinated self-renewal
              and fusion of myogenic stem and progenitor cells. Single-cell
              gene expression analyses of myogenesis have been hampered by the
              poor sampling of rare and transient cell states that are critical
              for muscle repair, and do not inform the spatial context that is
              important for myogenic differentiation. Here, we demonstrate how
              large-scale integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomic
              data can overcome these limitations. We created a single-cell
              transcriptomic dataset of mouse skeletal muscle by integration,
              consensus annotation, and analysis of 23 newly collected scRNAseq
              datasets and 88 publicly available single-cell (scRNAseq) and
              single-nucleus (snRNAseq) RNA-sequencing datasets. The resulting
              dataset includes more than 365,000 cells and spans a wide range
              of ages, injury, and repair conditions. Together, these data
              enabled identification of the predominant cell types in skeletal
              muscle, and resolved cell subtypes, including endothelial
              subtypes distinguished by vessel-type of origin, fibro-adipogenic
              progenitors defined by functional roles, and many distinct immune
              populations. The representation of different experimental
              conditions and the depth of transcriptome coverage enabled robust
              profiling of sparsely expressed genes. We built a densely sampled
              transcriptomic model of myogenesis, from stem cell quiescence to
              myofiber maturation, and identified rare, transitional states of
              progenitor commitment and fusion that are poorly represented in
              individual datasets. We performed spatial RNA sequencing of mouse
              muscle at three time points after injury and used the integrated
              dataset as a reference to achieve a high-resolution, local
              deconvolution of cell subtypes. We also used the integrated
              dataset to explore ligand-receptor co-expression patterns and
              identify dynamic cell-cell interactions in muscle injury
              response. We provide a public web tool to enable interactive
              exploration and visualization of the data. Our work supports the
              utility of large-scale integration of single-cell transcriptomic

               spatial structures is a topic of great interest in plant
               ecology. Univariate measurements of spatial autocorrelation such
               as Moran's I and Geary's c are widely used, but extensions to
               the multivariate case (i.e. multi-species) are rare. Here, we
               propose a multivariate spatial analysis based on Moran's I
               (MULTISPATI) by introducing a row-sum standardized spatial
               weight matrix in the statistical triplet notation. This
               analysis, which is a generalization of Wartenberg's approach to
               multivariate spatial correlation, would imply a compromise
               between the relations among many variables (multivariate
               analysis) and their spatial structure (autocorrelation).
               MULTISPATI approach is very flexible and can handle various
               kinds of data (quantitative and/or qualitative data, contingency
               tables). A study is presented to illustrate the method using a

               analysis (PCA) is applied without consideration for important
               spatial effects, and in doing so, tends to provide an incomplete
               understanding of a given process. In such circumstances, a
               spatial adaptation of PCA can be adopted, and to this end, this
               study focuses on the use of geographically weighted principal
               component analysis (GWPCA). GWPCA is a localized version of PCA
               that is an appropriate exploratory tool when a need exists to
               investigate for a certain spatial heterogeneity in the structure
               of a multivariate data set. This study provides enhancements to
               GWPCA with respect to: (i) finding the scale at which each
               localized PCA should operate; and (ii) visualizing the copious
               amounts of output that result from its application. An extension
               of GWPCA is also proposed, where it is used to detect
               multivariate spatial outliers. These advancements in GWPCA are
               demonstrated using an environmental freshwater chemistry data
               set, where a commentary on the use of preprocessed (transformed
               and standardized) data is also presented. The study is

  abstract  = "The identification of spatial structures is a key step in
               understanding the ecological processes structuring the
               distribution of organisms. Spatial patterns in species
               distributions result from a combination of several processes
               occuring at different scales: identifying these scales is thus a
               crucial issue. Recent studies have proposed a new family of
               spatial predictors (PCNM: principal coordinates of neighbours
               matrices; MEMs: Moran's eigenvectors maps) that allow for
               modelling of spatial variation on different scales. To assess
               the multi-scale spatial patterns in multivariate data, these
               variables are often used as predictors in constrained ordination
               methods. However, the selection of the appropriate spatial
               predictors is still troublesome, and the identification of the
               main scales of spatial variation remains an open question. This
               paper presents a new statistical tool to tackle this issue: the
               multi-scale pattern analysis (MSPA). This ordination method uses
               MEMs to decompose ecological variability into several spatial
               scales and then summarizes this decomposition using graphical
               representations. A canonical form of MSPA can also be used to
               assess the spatial scales of the species-environment
               relationships. MSPA is compared to constrained ordination using
               simulated data, and illustrated using the famous oribatid mites
