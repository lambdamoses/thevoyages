  abstract  = "Spatial transcriptomics are a collection of genomic technologies
               that have enabled transcriptomic profiling on tissues with
               spatial localization information. Analyzing spatial
               transcriptomic data is computationally challenging, as the data
               collected from various spatial transcriptomic technologies are
               often noisy and display substantial spatial correlation across
               tissue locations. Here, we develop a spatially-aware dimension
               reduction method, SpatialPCA, that can extract a low dimensional
               representation of the spatial transcriptomics data with
               biological signal and preserved spatial correlation structure,
               thus unlocking many existing computational tools previously
               developed in single-cell RNAseq studies for tailored analysis of
               spatial transcriptomics. We illustrate the benefits of
               SpatialPCA for spatial domain detection and explores its utility
               for trajectory inference on the tissue and for high-resolution
               spatial map construction. In the real data applications,
               SpatialPCA identifies key molecular and immunological signatures
               in a detected tumor surrounding microenvironment, including a
               tertiary lymphoid structure that shapes the gradual
               transcriptomic transition during tumorigenesis and metastasis.
               In addition, SpatialPCA detects the past neuronal developmental
               history that underlies the current transcriptomic landscape
               across tissue locations in the cortex. Spatial transcriptomics
               analyses can be affected by noise and spatial correlation across
               tissue locations. Here, the authors develop SpatialPCA, a
               spatially-aware dimensionality reduction method that explicitly
               models spatial correlation structures, and show its application
               to the analysis of healthy and tumour tissues.",

  title    = "Nonnegative spatial factorization applied to spatial genomics",
  author   = "Townes, F William and Engelhardt, Barbara E",
  abstract = "Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used to analyze
              high-dimensional count data because, in contrast to real-valued
              alternatives such as factor analysis, it produces an
              interpretable parts-based representation. However, in
              applications such as spatial transcriptomics, NMF fails to
              incorporate known structure between observations. Here, we
              present nonnegative spatial factorization (NSF), a
              spatially-aware probabilistic dimension reduction model based on
              transformed Gaussian processes that naturally encourages sparsity
              and scales to tens of thousands of observations. NSF recovers
              ground truth factors more accurately than real-valued
              alternatives such as MEFISTO in simulations, and has lower
              out-of-sample prediction error than probabilistic NMF on three
              spatial transcriptomics datasets from mouse brain and liver.
              Since not all patterns of gene expression have spatial
              correlations, we also propose a hybrid extension of NSF that
              combines spatial and nonspatial components, enabling
              quantification of spatial importance for both observations and
              features. A TensorFlow implementation of NSF is available from

              reduction in genome biology, with applications from personalized
              health to single-cell biology. Existing factor analysis models
              assume independence of the observed samples, an assumption that
              fails in spatio-temporal profiling studies. Here we present
              MEFISTO, a flexible and versatile toolbox for modeling
              high-dimensional data when spatial or temporal dependencies
              between the samples are known. MEFISTO maintains the established
              benefits of factor analysis for multimodal data, but enables the
              performance of spatio-temporally informed dimensionality
              reduction, interpolation, and separation of smooth from
              non-smooth patterns of variation. Moreover, MEFISTO can integrate
              multiple related datasets by simultaneously identifying and
              aligning the underlying patterns of variation in a data-driven
              manner. To illustrate MEFISTO, we apply the model to different

  abstract = "Motivation Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) shows its
              impressive power in yielding biological insights into
              neuroscience, disease study, and even plant biology. However,
              current methods do not sufficiently explore the expressiveness of
              the multi-modal SRT data, leaving a large room for improvement of
              performance. Moreover, the current deep learning based methods
              lack interpretability due to the ``black box'' nature, impeding
              its further applications in the areas that require explanation.
              Results We propose conST, a powerful and flexible SRT data
              analysis framework utilizing contrastive learning techniques.
              conST can learn low-dimensional embeddings by effectively
              integrating multi-modal SRT data, i . e . gene expression,
              spatial information, and morphology (if applicable). The learned
              embeddings can be then used for various downstream tasks,
              including clustering, trajectory and pseudotime inference,
              cell-to-cell interaction, etc . Extensive experiments in various
              datasets have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and
              robustness of the proposed conST, achieving up to 10\%
              improvement in clustering ARI in the commonly used benchmark
              dataset. We also show that the learned embedding can be used in
              complicated scenarios, such as predicting cancer progression by
              analyzing the tumour microenvironment and cell-to-cell
              interaction (CCI) of breast cancer. Our framework is
              interpretable in that it is able to find the correlated spots
              that support the clustering, which matches the CCI interaction
              pairs as well, providing more confidence to clinicians when
              making clinical decisions. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement

              spatial information using spatially regularized deep graph
