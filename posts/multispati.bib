  abstract = "Skeletal muscle repair is driven by the coordinated self-renewal
              and fusion of myogenic stem and progenitor cells. Single-cell
              gene expression analyses of myogenesis have been hampered by the
              poor sampling of rare and transient cell states that are critical
              for muscle repair, and do not inform the spatial context that is
              important for myogenic differentiation. Here, we demonstrate how
              large-scale integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomic
              data can overcome these limitations. We created a single-cell
              transcriptomic dataset of mouse skeletal muscle by integration,
              consensus annotation, and analysis of 23 newly collected scRNAseq
              datasets and 88 publicly available single-cell (scRNAseq) and
              single-nucleus (snRNAseq) RNA-sequencing datasets. The resulting
              dataset includes more than 365,000 cells and spans a wide range
              of ages, injury, and repair conditions. Together, these data
              enabled identification of the predominant cell types in skeletal
              muscle, and resolved cell subtypes, including endothelial
              subtypes distinguished by vessel-type of origin, fibro-adipogenic
              progenitors defined by functional roles, and many distinct immune
              populations. The representation of different experimental
              conditions and the depth of transcriptome coverage enabled robust
              profiling of sparsely expressed genes. We built a densely sampled
              transcriptomic model of myogenesis, from stem cell quiescence to
              myofiber maturation, and identified rare, transitional states of
              progenitor commitment and fusion that are poorly represented in
              individual datasets. We performed spatial RNA sequencing of mouse
              muscle at three time points after injury and used the integrated
              dataset as a reference to achieve a high-resolution, local
              deconvolution of cell subtypes. We also used the integrated
              dataset to explore ligand-receptor co-expression patterns and
              identify dynamic cell-cell interactions in muscle injury
              response. We provide a public web tool to enable interactive
              exploration and visualization of the data. Our work supports the

              alternatives such as factor analysis, it produces an
              interpretable parts-based representation. However, in
              applications such as spatial transcriptomics, NMF fails to
              incorporate known structure between observations. Here, we
              present nonnegative spatial factorization (NSF), a
              spatially-aware probabilistic dimension reduction model based on
              transformed Gaussian processes that naturally encourages sparsity

              ground truth factors more accurately than real-valued

              out-of-sample prediction error than probabilistic NMF on three

              Since not all patterns of gene expression have spatial

              current methods do not sufficiently explore the expressiveness of
              the multi-modal SRT data, leaving a large room for improvement of
              performance. Moreover, the current deep learning based methods
              lack interpretability due to the ``black box'' nature, impeding
              its further applications in the areas that require explanation.
              Results We propose conST, a powerful and flexible SRT data
              analysis framework utilizing contrastive learning techniques.
              conST can learn low-dimensional embeddings by effectively
              integrating multi-modal SRT data, i . e . gene expression,
              spatial information, and morphology (if applicable). The learned
              embeddings can be then used for various downstream tasks,
              including clustering, trajectory and pseudotime inference,

              improvement in clustering ARI in the commonly used benchmark
