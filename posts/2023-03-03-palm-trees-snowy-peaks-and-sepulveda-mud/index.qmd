Captain's Log, stardate 100753.94, Earth date February 26, 2023.

LA got a blizzard warning, the first time since 1989, as the cold storm came on Thursday, February 23. I was in my office and saw hail bouncing off the metal strip beneath the window. Friday saw an entire day of heavy rain, hence grouding starship Voyager. The rain became lighter on Saturday, but still lasted until the night. The rain forced me to rest and recover. In other words, get more work done. Internet feels like oxygen these days. The storm on Friday night caused a wifi outage. Not wanting to ride in the rain, I stayed at home on Saturday. What to do without wifi? Life continued. I read papers I had already downloaded and wrote some code. My impulses to check Mastodon and search random stuff was foregrounded and checked -- I lived without it totally fine. I could better focus. Today, the rain stopped and the sun came out, though the forecast says that the rain will resume next Monday to Wednesday. As if God bless CicLAvia, in the Valley, from Reseda to Canoga Park. 

I mean, the _other_ valley:

```{r}
stringr::str_replace("SGV", "G", "F")
```

The San Fernando Valley (SFV), which had its own mission and a distinctive dialect of the [Tataviam](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=3e3805bd4991426982f261fbe3f5f694) people, mutually intelligible with the Tongva language elsewhere in LA. Though apparently not everyone agrees that Pasadena is in the San Gabriel Valley (SGV), probably because the [Raymond Dyke](https://www.arroyoseco.org/groundwater.htm) fault separates Pasadena (actually also Sierra Madre and Aradia north of Huntington Dr) from the rest of the SGV, forming the hills in San Marino and between Pasadena and South Pasadena. [Mapping LA](https://maps.latimes.com/neighborhoods/region/verdugos/) considers Pasadena part of the Verdugos rather than SGV. Since "SFV" is reminiscent of the acronym of my R package `SpatialFeatureExperiment` (SFE), I thought about giving this blog the name `SpatialGenomicValley` (SGV), but the current name was more popular among those I asked.

# On the way
## From Pasadena to Burbank

It's certainly not my first time seeing snow on the southern slope of Mt Wilson, but this time the amount of snow made it almost look like the Alps. 

![Mt Wilson with unusual amount of snow, from Los Robles and Corson in Pasadena](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/E72ayLvv7Jeq/kW9Ti5Ayw1cbkftVOumnnCHDJ3mQYIxlMqpe2AJN.jpg)

I was trying to make it to the Friends of CicLAvia lunch starting at 11:30 am in Reseda. Nevertheless, I couldn't help but stopped for photos of some cool buildings and the snowy peaks along the way. I'm sure that nobody shows up on time anyway.

As I rode through Glendale and Burbank, I saw the Verdugo mountains in snow, the first time in my life. 

![Verdugo mountain snow, from Glenoaks and Western in Burbank](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/4JclmiPcYvUE/2aNmFmPCyfefoP1Dfxf1GTdC111vXtgMn9JVTJS9.jpg)

## North Hollywood
I descended Magnolia through the heart of Burbank, before getting to the Chandler bike path in Burbank and North Hollywood Arts District where there are some cool murals. See some of the murals from previous trips on [PixelFed](https://pixelfed.social/p/lambdamoses/536464700020111810).

![Chandler bike path mural](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/9paWRihEsY40/C62WYa37GVbctRcGFQbIGPerukmgfCAtqZk5MX99.jpg)

The Little Tujunga mountains also got snowy peaks, which can be seen from the North Hollywood Metro station and Tujunga Wash, while they're normally not tall enough to get snow. 

![North Hollywood Station, note the snowy peaks in the distance](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/xYphVqJcVsrK/hvY8odSEVgRT4XmBBFXrlLjswhJFhAXhPTl71pon.jpg)

![Tujunga Wash, see snowy peaks in the distance](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/HwT12MBaqw6y/XqWgXQ0dtrKw5ETOOl8ZYmUh6jrGT0ZDrESejyy8.jpg)

While the Pacific Electric is long gone, many of its relics are preserved, such as the Lankershim depot near modern North Hollywood Station. If they could build great transit over 100 years ago, then why can't they do it now?

![Lankershim depot near North Hollywood Station](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/KIEJ0Zf5yLU2/2Biupz0P1s3jP7yu7SGT6oKtaOPtO4Vf2syxnzpA.jpg)

## Orange Line bike path
In my original plan, I wanted to ride on as much of bike paths along tributaries of LA River as possible, including on the Tujunga Wash, with the Great Wall of LA mural, which I visited last January. Considering that I certainly couldn't make it to Reseda by 11:30 am, I skipped most of that part, only taking a glimpse of the mural. I saw a great photo of the mural reflected in the water below at the LA Public Library and wanted to reproduce it, with the soft morning light. However, that didn't work because the water was flowing too fast and with too many wavelets to form a visible reflection of the mural. There's an airplane in that photo, heading east, probably to the Bob Hope airport in Burbank. I have been to upstream parts of Tujunga Wash, including Hansen Dam, Big Tujunga Creek, Little Tujunga Creek, and Pacoima Wash in previous voyages. These voyages weave together like a fabric, weaving together my experience and love of LA.

![Great Wall of LA](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/5VtBwbn9lkWx/WNxaDLl9p7SbZJUo0TH0F1B5QgVXjbIGa30HsXOl.jpg)

Then 6 miles of Orange Line bike path. On the bike path, I encountered several others which I speculated to be heading to CicLAvia. Likewise, they wondered if I was also heading to CicLAvia. One part of the Orange Line bike path was flooded. We all confirmed that we were heading to CicLAvia on our way out of the Sepulveda Basin, about to leave the Orange Line bike path. I had to ride on the road, on White Oak Ave and Sherman Way, before getting to CicLAvia. Fortunately there was a bike lane. As I arrived on Sherman Way but before getting to CicLAvia, I saw more cyclists, presumably also heading the same way.

![Part of the bike path was flooded, at Sepulveda Basin](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/UMpJ759gJ0l2/iO5004bSmzndPkLDnhOn7EYNEqcBoNUB6cyiSL1l.jpg)

![Fallen tree on the bike path](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/xO6YL7BurmiR/Izi9W4PTiGACnNcix9d7d3OOdYV8L36A2FK1GJtB.jpg)

This region is most likely the Siutcanga village of the Tataviam. According to the O My Ancestors book, back in the 1980s, developers around here found an Indigenous burial ground, and the then new lawyer Michael Barthelemy, of the Tongva leader family of David, Sparky, Art, and Anthony Morales, was contacted to negotiate reburial. As a then new lawyer, he couldn't stop the development, but managed a reburial. The site is around Victory and Balboa Blvds.

![Victory and Balboa, just to document](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/eV4OMLctZroL/Klb9ddoftMgZmkeL2PCxDNrfmQcj5JfKqd5XPoeF.jpg)

# CicLAvia
## Reseda

Before getting to the Friends of CicLAvia lunch, I got to see the iconic Reseda sign in the median; it would be way harder to take a photo of it outside CicLAvia.

![Reseda sign on Sherman Way](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/bcet184uHx9t/ZTovYBEQL5jUrHyK448umH22QVdURBrMaR2r6x0i.jpg)

![Entering the Reseda pedestrian zone, the east end of the route](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/K0T9ug5JzJmI/p3Yy2NkCGgcPhomodVZPlamIBGQkzdAhWb3F5dxx.jpg)

![DJs playing electronic music, unfortunately this photo doesn't come with music. Apparently at least some of their equipment was solar powered. Not sure how well that works on this cloudy day.](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/Dc7WPI21fJ6N/H4hSq36xkBSpN6ycNUtx43sgS5KoxlrRrU7PUwkk.jpg)

![Bike mechanics at Reseda Hub](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/TZ6mNkvKBtPS/poNbVESXU4TFeOQJMvAoUBWaFaxOAa2QuoSEwK4R.jpg)

Also the Reseda Theatre, which shuttered in 1988. Historical photos can be seen [here](https://losangelestheatres.blogspot.com/2020/01/reseda-theatre.html). The facade was remodeled sometime between 1958 and 1963, the height of the atompunk era in retrofuturistic terms, hence the Googie atompunk style we see today.

![Reseda Theatre, remember that guy in the yellow shirt on Orange Line bike path](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/0LTwZ96zLttC/1gzHAfomkfBXXSvMP6IGvrVzAQIEo2UVJWoaWeak.jpg){width=60%}

![The other side of Reseda Theatre, with murals](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/igBv4gvVTMvU/FvsfUEv03PrcIY5ThEytcx5fhn7NiPXVzfeXjz3J.jpg)

## Friends of CicLAvia lunch
It was a little past 12 pm when I got to the Vinh Loi Tofu restaurant for the Friends of CicLAvia lunch. I was not late. 

![CicLAvia buttons at the restaurant for us monthly donors](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/uDP8VbOdVSIZ/ElItORerbi0ivKBZRd7taGhAjdy8BsC7qxTpZbBx.jpg)

We didn't all sit down to start at the same time. Instead, we grabbed food as we came. Everything is vegan. The vegan meat substitutes in the bah mi and spring rolls were so good. Too bad they gave us disposable plates. Again, why didn't I bring my own? But at least I didn't have to pay for the food.

![My lunch](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/ptbG2KMpY0Do/ROAl6pUp9ziuBWo3nfjqAD1Spm5LFtvSWzgIm13u.jpg)

This is a vegan restaurant, and the owner, ever grumpy and on the move, races Ironman, which is impressive by my standard even though I ride gran fondos quite often because in an Ironman you have to swim and run in addition to riding a gran fondo and there are no traffic lights and photo stops for you to rest. Because when riding more than 80 miles, I usually stop for lunch which often makes me so full that my stomach would get upset if I ride hard right after, how Ironman racers fuel during the lengthy race remains kind of a mystery to me. Proof that going vegan doesn't make you weak and sick. 

![The grumpy restaurant owner and his Ironman medals; from the Buddha statue, I think he's most likely vegan because of his Buddhist faith.](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/uHadzIeqwIFi/om9WLx7IN6iw4IYgMlZw5VCHS2EN5YDrkPL462IZ.jpg)

![Probably the owner's wife, not so grumpy. Feeling too awkward to talk to them.](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/04hrG5Q8rBuY/a81GM2EEELnzZlgaMhJSnBAd02ahli3J91FJGwnM.jpg)

Also at lunch, I met a few East Side Riders whom I met on [February 11](https://lambdamoses.github.io/thevoyages/posts/2023-02-20-east-side-riders/). They remember me.

![East Side Riders, also friends of CicLAvia](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/PUU8q4PWwZKh/jOi7HqKJKOoF3t46PVDVf8vfgEQoQiKnD9mWaYwb.jpg)

## Reseda, continued
Across the street from the restaurant is the Bridge Bible Fellowship, where the church band was performing during CicLAvia, in typical contemporary hymn style. 

![Bridge Bible Fellowship](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/6UgMq9e9Uf7w/BzhZJerw5jAuJnyiLvbnhsfN4w2vKgvVHIoh44f8.jpg)

Then I crossed Aliso Canyon Wash, and came across the cool murals of the pediatric clinic, O&P in Motion. Yes, I have been to an upstream part of Aliso Canyon Wash, the Porter Ranch Park, after lunch at a Lebanese restaurant in the shopping mall during my second century, in December 2021.

![O&P mural](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/4tlLfBGHhGV5/xYNWxHKPlsrJBKk6Rl9dB17dTDFfsKvtFTMwP9de.jpg)

## Winnetka
Then I rode towards Winnetka, the neighborhood to the west of Reseda, with the Mid Century Modern DWP, the iconic Victorian building, and some beautiful churches. Some suburbian residential areas separate the mini-downtowns of the neighborhood.

![From Reseda to Winnetka](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/goE1Z3ONinVB/w1Gyn8jw4ttj2F9oUHmajI5kMVNfjzQWY6MZ9JNs.jpg)

![Even businesses near the iconic Victorian building are named Victoria.

![You might have noticed a church tower in the distance in the first photo of the Victorian buildings. Here it is up close.](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/R8dmsUYRBkye/VSCkkQn3pCj7oiH1iwOPf0iEjFgD6xmrSTFGP36u.jpg){width=60%}

## Canoga Park
After Winnetka was Canoga Park, with some Googie atompunk buildings, including the car wash and Wienerschnitzel at De Soto. I was looking for some Googie buildings so iconic of vintage car culture and juxtapose them with cyclists and pedestrians, since car culture is so hostile to the latter.

![Wienerschnitzel](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/M0kpWTSZ94oe/C92k4iHwURCj0EgDel9YxsBPEr20hFy8dVHRE1zT.jpg)

Further west: Discount Tires and the historical [Madrid Theatre](https://losangelestheatres.blogspot.com/2020/01/madrid-theatre.html) (and one of the photos on the linked website was taken during the 2019 CicLAvia) at [Owensmouth](https://lastreetnames.com/street/owensmouth-avenue/) (yes, because of the aqueduct bringing Owens Valley water to the SFV), and the legacy Cavaretta's Italian Deli a little west of Topanga Canyon Blvd. 

![I took a photo of someone else taking a photo with a real camera at Madrid Theatre. So I'm not the only one.](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/T1ytPCXzN5Ks/WQlWCvNmPUrGx4zFoyaYKzpbElpvD3h83aXYkps2.jpg)

After spending some time at the Canoga Park hub, where I got to sample some different bike cultures, I left the route at Owensmouth and headed to my own adventure, to ride on as much of LA River bike paths as possible.

![Heading to the last pedestrian zone, Canoga Park](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/ELYtWwoR9u2I/1dFkGuJ0icvC2QOt5hbgQ1p9P6JYtjoNqyqp6QeE.jpg)

I made a U turn and made a right on Owensmouth to depart CicLAvia, leading to LA River. BTW, this is the most upstream place where LA River is called LA River. Further upstream, in the Santa Monica Mountains, there are Arroyo Calabassas and Bell Breek. 

![Cool mural of Canoga Park Florist on Owensmouth](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/0e2JAO23xqow/mAqGL1UanMN4ABp116MO08ZkZb0J0ov5wyDQIHzF.jpg)

![This part of Owensmouth south of Sherman Way was also at least in part closed to cars, looking south towards Woodland Hills.](https://media.pixelfed.social/public/m/_v2/529845376367415532/42a8ecf32-5a8865/39abHlJ0YTjH/5y8acc8bkDenXOpQUfmFUeIzdViKP4S9eu8FCGjX.jpg)

Photography lessons learnt: I made mistakes and learn from mistakes. Number one, one thing CicLAvia taught me is that it turns out that shooting environmental portraits is fun. Which I totally didn't expect given that I'm introverted and don't like talking to strangers. Here's how it got started: Last December, I went to Samy's Camera in Pasadena for Mark Edward Harris's class on travel photography, which happened to be free as part of Nikon Day. He talked about environmental portraits. The next day, I tried to practice what I learnt in CicLAvia, and tried to take an environmental portrait of a bike mechanic at the Exposition Park hub.

My greatest cycling achievement is that it helped me to overcome years of social anxiety, because the aerobic exercise induced endorphin made me less nervous and over time the evidence built up that talking to people isn't scary. It didn't make me extraverted, but it did make me less scared of talking to people. Also, probably especially because LA is so bike unfriendly, cyclists tend to be nice to each other. At least for us Lycra road warriors, we culturally greet each other on the road even if we don't know each other, as if saying, "Hey, we have the same mental illness." In contrast, when I went to more bike friendly cities such as Seattle, Portland, Sacramento, and Davis, there were so many cyclists that nobody thinks twice, so we generally didn't greet each other. 

So long story short, I got opened up to people and find it fun to take photos of them, especially when it comes to different aspects of cycling culture. When learning photography, I prioritized landscape and city, since presumably that's what I expect in my voyages; generally I want the entire scene to be sharp, so smaller apertures and polarizing filter. This time I found out that my go to travel lens -- a lightweight and versatile Panasonic G Vario 12-60 mm zoom lens for micro four thirds (I chose MFT because it and its lenses are smaller so easier for me to carry when climbing thousands of feet in one trip) -- doesn't have large enough an aperture to make that nice background blur. I was already using the largest aperture I had for the focal length (f/3.5 and gets smaller as I zoom in) and it couldn't create enough of a background blur which would make those portraits nicer. So time to burn some money on some f/1.8 portrait lenses, second hand of course. While MAMILs are notorious for burning money on cycling gears, I find that photography gear gets really expensive much more quickly than cycling gear, so buying new with the bit of grad school stipend I saved by not flying, not driving, and not eating out is unthinkable. I suppose if with better photos, I can make cycling in LA look cool and change then way people think about LA so we can better work towards green transport and Vision Zero, then the few hundred bucks for the lenses are worth it. 

Number two, I got to befriend shutter priority and burst mode. I made a mistake of not setting fast enough a shutter speed. While 1/250 second is good enough for cyclists further away and pedestrians, it's too slow for cyclists that are closer, so I got a blurry shot that otherwise has great composition (not shown here) which I kept on my external HD as a record. I really should use 1/1000. Somehow I found that crazy fast, probably because I often use a polarizing filter and smaller aperture for landscape shots (actually f/8 rather than the conventional f/16 most of time as that's the sharpest for my MFT lenses), leading to slower shutter speed, which makes me think 1/250 is fast enough. 

Number three, I made a really dumb mistake that ruined an otherwise nice portrait in Canoga Park of BMX riders -- I focused the wrong area, and given that I used the largest aperture I had, intending to blur out the background with shallower depth of field, the riders got blurry. Then I just realized that my camera has a face priority mode that would automatically focus on detected faces. The riders are generally really happy and cooperative with me taking photos of them. It's not that awkward. 

Number four, I made the merger mistake again and didn't realize until I looked at my photos at home on my laptop, but it's so hard to avoid all mergers when there are so many things in the background. Be more careful next time, and burst mode might help. Also, I wonder how pros get all the settings ready in a changing situation so they don't miss the shot by the time they're done with the settings. I suppose for the next CicLAvia in April, I'll change to a portrait lens and get the settings ready before I enter the first pedestrian zone.
