    "text": "Seurat is the standard package to analyze single cell and spatial -omics data in R, and Scanpy is the standard in Python. There has long been the R vs. Python debate in data science, though many, including myself, would say both R and Python though I use them for different data analysis tasks. However, many people do prefer one language to the other for a variety of reasons. I’m not here to add fuel to the flame war. Rather, I’m elaborating on the observation that the choice of language can greatly affect biological conclusions, because Seurat and Scanpy have different defaults and internals most users may be unaware of, so by using the default settings of the de facto standard single cell and spatial -omics package in our language of choice, we inadvertently end up with different conclusions, which is bad news for reproducibility. For example, Seurat and Scanpy give quite different log fold changes for marker genes:\nFor the R package Voyager, we try to avoid this. Our collaborators in Iceland are working on a Python implementation of Voyager for those who prefer Python, and are writing “compatibility tests” to make sure that the R and Python implementations of Voyager give consistent results for core functionalities, such as those in the most introductory vignettes of R Voyager that don’t go beyond Moran’s I in spatial analysis. However, on the long run, we don’t expect the R and Python implementations to match everywhere, since some tools may be available in only one of R and Python, such as statistical tools specific to R and deep learning tools specific to Python. It turns out that with default settings, the same data normalization, and same list of highly variable genes, R and Python Voyagers gave different PCA results, because of a cryptic difference that R divides by n-1 (unbiased estimate when mean is unknown) while Scipy divides by n (maximum likelihood estimate) when computing variance. For better reproducibility, these hidden defaults should be made transparent. This made us wonder if – using default settings – whether Seurat and Scanpy give consistent PCA results."

I did not regress out any variable when scaling data with Seurat. I will later find out what causes this discrepancy, but for now, let’s also look at the discrepancies in spot embeddings and gene loadings."

The black segments in the plot connect corresponding points from Seurat and Scanpy embeddings. If the discrepancy is sizable, then the segment will be visible, which is sometimes the case, especially for spots with high PC1 values in this plot. Also see PCs 3-4:\n\nplot_pca_compare(pca_embeddings, pca_embeddings_py, pcs = 3:4,\n                 title = \"PCA embeddings, Seurat vs. Scanpy\")\n\n\n\n\nThe discrepancies are larger in PCs 3-4, with the segment visible almost everywhere and longer among points with higher absolute values on PC4. Since more than 4 PCs are typically used for clustering, and the clusters are then used for differential expression, such discrepancies might manifest in different biological conclusions.\nSince it’s not easy to plot all 20 PCs as scatter plots, we compare the PCA embeddings numerically:\n\nplot_r_py_pc_diffs <- function(mat_r, mat_py, npcs = 20, title = NULL) {\n    diffs <- numeric(npcs)\n    for (i in seq_len(npcs)) {\n        pc_r <- mat_r[,i]\n        pc_py <- mat_py[,i]\n        diffs[i] <- min(mean(abs(pc_r - pc_py)), mean(abs(pc_r + pc_py))) # flipped\n    }\n    tibble(difference = diffs,\n           PC = seq_len(npcs)) |> \n        ggplot(aes(PC, difference)) +\n        geom_line() +\n        geom_hline(yintercept = sqrt(.Machine$double.eps), linetype = 2) +\n        scale_y_log10() +\n        scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::breaks_width(2)) +\n        annotation_logticks(sides = \"l\") +\n        labs(title = title, y = \"Mean absolute difference\")\n}\n\nBecause the PCs can be flipped, we compare the PCs one by one:\n\nplot_r_py_pc_diffs(pca_embeddings, pca_embeddings_py, \n                   title = \"Differences in embeddings, Seurat vs. Scanpy\")\n\n\n\n\nThe differences are large, and get larger with PCs that explain less variance, far beyond epsilon explainable by machine precision (dashed horizontal line), which is around 1.5e-8. The mean absolute difference across spots rises from about 0.01 for PC1 to 1 and higher after PC9."

    "text": "Captain’s Log, stardate 100712.73. Earth date 02/11/2023, but it took me a while to write the Captain’s Log. To support free and open source software (FOSS), I put my photos on Pixelfed, a FOSS alternative to Instagram that can be self-hosted, though they’re not well-organized there; Captain’s Log is where you find their contexts but you can dig through all my photos on Pixelfed. I wish that there’s a FOSS alternative to Strava. It’s probably not difficult to implement. However, I haven’t completely quit corporate mass surveillance social media because many people and organizations I follow are only on corporate social media. I’ve been pretty satisfied with Mastodon so far. Still new to Pixelfed so can’t comment much yet. Mastodon, Pixelfed, and many other social network apps are part of the Fediverse. Please give Fediverse a shot!\n\n\n\nFlyer for this ride; I’m not the only person calling bike rides “voyages”.\n\n\n“I probably can’t make it,” I said to myself, as I just snoozed for 20 minutes. Now I’m blessed with flexible work schedule, but if I keep on living this way, then I’ll be doomed once I lose this flexibility after I graduate. I kept on getting up too late, until I need to yank myself out of bed to either conform to an earlier social schedule of events or maximize daylight time for a voyage. Because without Frozen Turkey, I often have trouble stopping what I’m doing, ending up staying up. Willowbrook is kind of far from Pasadena. Taking into account traffic lights and the slow and chaotic part of DTLA, it would realistically take me about 1 and a half hours to ride hard and fast to cover the 21 miles to get to Willowbrook, where this family friendly East Side Rider ride took place. I only had less than 1:15 left. Anyway, if I still feel tired, then I’ll go elsewhere, like re_ grocery first and then Monrovia. Or worst case scenario, they leave without me, and I’ll just continue on my own adventure, to check out some murals and interesting places on Central Ave that I blew past last time in CicLAvia last December. Or perhaps, just like the Tour de North Carson last March, I rode hard but still arrived 2 minutes late, only to find out that they wouldn’t roll until half an hour later, so I had quite a bit of time to kill, talking to other riders.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the way to Willowbrook\nThe slow part of DTLA began, slow because of frequent stops, from traffic lights, and because cars and shared scooters not being ridden often block the bike lane. My usual route through DTLA takes the N Spring St bike lane. The part of Spring St by the LA City Hall was closed, for an Iranian protest, presumably against the official celebration of the 44th anniversary of the Iranian “Islamic” Republic. The protest hadn’t started yet. But Boo! Lots of Iranian Imperial flags. Maybe monarchists there. Death to monarchy, and death to all forms of authoritarianism! Anyway, I was running late. No time to take photos or to talk to people. While the road was closed, I could ride on the sidewalk, just more slowly. Meanwhile – not to downplay the atrocities committed by the blasphemous Iranian government – I wonder, on January 21, why couldn’t we close the road when we protested against the death of 312 people from traffic violence in LA City in 2022, which was overshadowed by the Monterey Park shooting that night in the news? Why couldn’t we close the road to protest against climate suicide as the car and fossil fuel industries resist climate action? Even many progressives don’t question car culture.\n\n\n\nStreets Are For Everyone (SAFE) die in on January 21, 2023, photo from BikinginLA. I’m the person next to the Grim Reaper and beneath the Vision Zero is Dying sign, holding the Cars Kill Chidren sign. Senator Portantino is at the lower right corner, in white and red. I talked to the person in the Grim Reaper costume. She has lived in LA for 7 years without a car. There’s the claim that most residential areas in LA are mostly flat, and with the nice weather, there’s no excuse for LA not to be a bike mecca. I think from my personal experience, the mostly flat claim is mosty true, but I need to do a formal analysis to see how true it is.\n\n\nInitially I planned to take a detour at 52nd street and Avalon Blvd to see the murals at Dr. Maya Angelou Community High School (where the “Hate has caused a lot of problems…” comes from) on the way to Willowbrook, but decided to go there on the way back instead because I was running late and my traffic light luck wasn’t great. There were many murals and walls full of graffiti in this region. Having been fascinated with graffiti since 2008 due to my first trip to LA, I put these graffiti walls in Highland Park in my Hall of Fame, but there were too many here for me to keep track. While it’s nice to have a protected bike lane, it’s annoying when it’s often blocked by cars (now I need to dodge the bollards) and when there’s more trash and potentially flat causing debris in the bike lane. I passed several cyclists, most likely local, riding cheap mountain or commuter bikes, often riding on the sidewalk, a very different culture from that of the rich middle aged men in Lycra (MAMILs). I wonder what those cyclists thought when I passed them. While I don’t really feel like I fit into the MAMIL culture, as if my voyages (especially the urban adventures) is a completely different sport, I certainly did dress the MAMIL way, adjusted for gender and age. It was cold, but I rode hard enough to work up a sweat.\n\n\nKill some time before rolling\nFinally, left turn at 120th St. I just rode over 120 blocks! Somehow that sounded impressive. Actually more than 120, because there are streets with the same number but different suffices, such as 52nd St and 52nd Pl. Here’s an imperfect explanation for the duplicates. I was at least 15 minutes late. I was right. When I got to Central Ave, I saw a bunch of cyclists at the parking lot at the East Side Riders bike shop and co-op, haven’t departed yet. This is a family friendly ride, not meant for speed craving road warriors. But everyone was welcome. This shop really likes fat-tired lowrider bikes. It also sold skates, which I also see used in CicLAvia. I also saw cruiser style e-bikes, and two Razor mini electric motorcycles without pedals. Nor was I the only roadiot there. There was at least one recent model road bike, and a few vintage ones.\n\n\n\nLowrider and cruiser bikes at the ESR bike shop\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lowrider bike depicted on that high vis vest, and the skates\n\n\nWhile I enjoy the thrill of speed, I did not come here for speed. Rather, I came to learn about the culture of South LA, in solidarity with this working class neighborhood of color. True, there are more dangerous roads and gangs, but I tend to find poor neighborhoods more vibrant and edgy than rich ones and graffiti is part of it. It’s precisely the edge that I like. A long term goal of the voyages is to learn about the different cultures of each region of LA, as well as different cycling cultures. Travel doesn’t have to be out of town. As an environmentalist, I try my best not to fly. So far the diverse nooks and crannies of LA have been sufficient to keep me mentally stimulated and made me more connected to the land and care more about local politics and history. That’s one of my favorite aspects of LA. I have participated in various types of cycling culture, such as the MAMIL roadie culture and road racing culture at my main club Pasadena Athletic Association (PAA), track racing culture at the Carson velodrome, advocacy culture with Bike LA (formerly LACBC), Pasadena Complete Streets Coalition, CicLAvia, Active SGV and Critical Mass, and bikepacking and touring culture.\nI came to this specific ride, of the advocacy culture (and I suppose lowrider culture as well), which I heard about from BikeLA’s newsletter, because I admire the missions of East Side Riders (ESR), which started off handing out food to the less fortunate by bike and has improved bike safety in Watts so “gang members know not to bother folks on bikes”, and People for Mobility Justice, which advocates for active transport in poor neighborhoods of color. I’m fascinated with murals and there are many in South Central (some I visited in this trip); that started with People for Mobility Justice’s Eastside mural ride guide. These murals document community history that may not be told in “official” history written by those in power, and they continue to influence my life, especially the “We are NOT a Minority” mural at Estrada Courts on Olympic from the Chicano Moratorium, which gave me confidence and hope in the rebellious movements behind the thin veneer engineered by those in power to show the tourists.\n\n\n\nIndeed, ride for love\n\n\nMost riders I saw were Black or Hispanic, but there were a few Asian and White riders. With my real camera, I could probably pass as the official photographer. I met two other guys with real cameras, at least one was the real official photographer, whose camera had a microphone attached to the hot shoe. He greeted me with a special sense of camaraderie as he saw me taking photos with my real camera.\nIt turned out that I wasn’t the one who came the furthest. One of the ride marshals drove all the way from Riverside. Maybe not the best for the environment, but he grew up around Willowbrook and Watts and misses the community here, so most likely he would rather live here rather than Riverside if possible. This reminds me of many students who fly across the continent or abroad several times a year to see their families. We need more systemic changes to save our planet, so those who wish to live together can more easily do so, and so plutocratic developers don’t undemocratically displace people from their deeply rooted communities at whim. Of course, a prerequisite is to liberate ourselves from egotistical microfascism and oppressive systems of beliefs, so we don’t end up like White NIMBYs protesting a Black neighbor moving in. LA is losing Black people, from gentrification of Black neighborhoods, pushing them to Antelope Valley and Inland Empire.\n\n\n\nThe Razor electric mini motorcycle. Earlier someone crashed it as it accelerated too quickly and she lost control.\n\n\n\n\nRide 4 love\nIt was almost 11 am. Finally ready to roll! It was so slow that I shifted to the small chain ring. Again, just like in Critical Mass, sometimes I would ride faster, getting way ahead of the “peloton”, to take photos of them coming, or I may stop by the side to take photos from behind and later catch up. We took up an entire lane, with the confidence and courage from safety in numbers, mostly riding outside the bike lane, where it’s only practical to ride single file. At intersections, the ride marshals in high vis vests would hold up traffic when the light turned red, so we could remain in one bloc. At one point (forgot exactly where) holding up traffic made the drivers quite furious, with horns blaring, but most of the time nobody complained and the traffic wasn’t heavy anyway.\n\n\n\nA few announcements before we roll. Those are the Ride 4 Love sweater, with two bike wheels forming a heart shape.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe took up an entire lane, heading north on Central\n\n\nNot having the route, I didn’t know the length of the ride, but I overheard someone saying about 12 miles. Riding 12 miles at this pace is no problem for me without refreshment, but we stopped a few times for refreshment and group photos, to cater to all fitness levels. I think that’s nice, because back in January 2021, I was so out of shape after years of unhealthy lifestyle that left me underweight that biking 2 miles or up a 2% hill could feel challenging. Each rest stop was quite long, which I spent in part talking to other riders.\n\n\n\nLowrider at the first rest stop at the plaza around Central and 109th St, with public art\n\n\n\n\n\nGathering for the first group photo\n\n\n\n\n\nI looked elsewhere while others posed for the group photo\n\n\nThese are some riders I talked to: Jenny from West Hollywood, and Maru from southeast LA. Jenny is an art student who often rides with various groups in the edgy fixie culture. She likes fixies and single speed bikes because of their simplicity and the challenge to climb on too hard a gear. Also, these bikes tend to be cheap and less attractive to thieves. She biked up Griffith Park and Elysian Park hills on a single speed bike and knows a group that does the Griffith Park ride at 6:30 am on fixies. I have met a fixie group at the scenic turnout in Griffith Park at dusk, probably a different group. Impressive, as I used my small chain ring for the climb. At the Tour de North Carson ride, I also met some fixie riders, one wearing an aero time trial helmet and fascinated with track racing while also riding a fixie with high gear ratio on the road.\nWe agree that South Central isn’t very safe to ride in, despite the Avalon bike lane, because of aggressive drivers, probably aggressive because the road designed for speed invites the aggression. Poor neighborhoods of color are often turned into highways, leading to more dangerous roads and worse pollution. Here we have the wide and fast roads, Avalon, Central, Florence, El Segundo, Firestone, Century Blvd, Imperial Hwy, and etc. crisscrossing the neighborhoods. In Santa Monica, Pasadena, and Boyle Heights, freeways have destroyed neighborhoods of color, while White neighborhoods were more likely to fight off planned freeways. How many highways are there in San Marino? Huntington Dr and Sierra Madre Blvd, and the part in San Marino isn’t that bad, with a lot of greenery. No freeways. I should do a more formal analysis of length of freeways and multi lane highways with high speed limit in different regions of LA and how that relates to redlining.\nWe also both like Highland Park, for her a climb, for me mostly bombing down the hills but I have to climb on the way back. While I learnt to ride a fixie at the Carson velodrome, I would only ride one in the velodrome as I can’t be sure to stop promptly at each intersection. What I learnt from the fixie is the track racing culture, which is very different from the urban fixie culture, such as that the track racers I met were overwhelmingly White while urban fixie riders I met tend to be more diverse, and that the urban fixie riders tend to show more of a rebellious vibe than track racers. However, from that Carson rider, there may be some overlap. I’m not sure if the Bahati Foundation that grew out of Compton is relevant to the intersection. On city streets, I have also witnessed the BMX culture, but I have never participated in it so I don’t know anything about it. See, I really think it would take years of research and a PhD thesis to write a book to comprehensively document all those different bike cultures in different regions of LA.\nMaru introduced me to the Pave Commute app which in theory has employers or sponsoring companies pay us for bike commutes. I signed up with the CiBiC LA group. I used the app a few times this week and got quite some “coins”, but I don’t yet know what I can use those coins for. It’s supposed to match people with similar routes to form group to commute together. I haven’t gotten a group yet, probably because I don’t go to my office on a fixed schedule and the app caters more to regions adjacent to DTLA and Lincoln Heights though it allowed me to join from Pasadena. We exchanged phone numbers, if we wish to ride together or if we want to go to CicLAvia and Critical Mass.\nWatts isn’t what I thought it is. We rode through a brand new seemingly posh and mostly uninhabited neighborhood around Century Blvd west of Alameda and we stopped at the Starbucks there, where I got some water. However, soon after, we saw much less posh Estrada Courts style apartment complexes. This is the Jordan Downs redevelopment and the shopping plaza with this Starbucks and Nike is also part of the redevelopment. The uninhabited buildings were probably not completed yet. Just like Estrada Courts, Jordan Downs is a public housing project initially built to house World War II workers. The new buildings are the redeveloped region, with a mix of market rate and affordable units, though the website doesn’t say exactly how many units are affordable. As of writing, the website says the rent of a one bedroom apartment is $673 and that of a two bedroom apartment is $1330, which does sound like an affordable rate, by Pasadena and Westside standards. Bummer: no pets 😿. The Estrada Courts style buildings are the old Jordan Downs. Burning question, does the redevelopment cause gentrification? Whichever case, even if it’s meant for gentrification, I see how it’s absorbing the surrounding culture, such as the mural at Starbucks, a style I don’t see in shopping centers targeting richer people in Pasadena, Glendale, Century City, and Beverly Hills.\n\n\n\nStarbucks mural\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Jordan Downs\n\n\n\n\n\nOld Jordan Downs\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is more typical of Watts, and see that lowrider in action. I tend to see more people riding bikes for errands in poor neighborhoods, and the bike on the sidewalk is unrelated to this ride.\n\n\nNext stop was Watts Towers, which I have visited twice before, first after the Tour de North Carson, and then in CicLAvia last December.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crowd at the Watts Towers plaza\n\n\n\n\n\nArts Center buliding\n\n\nThe sun was behind the towers when seen from the plaza, making some photos facing the sun challenging. But it can be a feature rather than a bug when I realized that the shadows cast by the towers are a feature.\n\n\n\nAbout to roll again\n\n\nAlso because of the direction of the sun, I got a better look up close at the other side of Watts Towers.\n\nThen we rode down Willowbrook Ave, next to the railroad, before the last rest stop at the Willowbrooks/Rosa Parks transit center. The ride leader said we were behind schedule and would make a shortcut to go back to the bike shop. I don’t know what the original plan was. Here Jenny took off, heading back to West Hollywood.\n\n\n\nThe mini motorcycles in action on Willowbrook Ave\n\n\nOh, I forgot to mention. We had a DJ, though I didn’t hear the music much because the peloton was so spread out. Here I caught the DJ bike in action:\n\n\n\nThe DJ bike, and look at what good time they’re having!\n\n\n\n\n\nSee her big smile mirroring mine\n\n\nBack at the bike shop. What did I learn? Well, that sounds too much like a school field trip and I’m too old for that. I did experience this community and culture and had fun. It’s only once, so not in depth. The ESR holds a ride every month, and I may come back. Let the experience ferment and influence me in subtle and subconscious ways, and let this thread of experience be woven into my tapestry of worldview. Oh, actually I can put some of what I learn to words: Thank you, ESR, for making Watts more awesome! I know that Watts has a bad reputation as one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in LA. It’s not my first time here though I always preferred to visit in a group for safety reasons (like I rode with the Carson fixie riders to Watts back in March and CicLAvia already has a group pretext), but this event further showed that Watts has a cool and vibrant culture and made me want to learn more about it. My visits humanized this much avoided neighborhood.\nI was hungry and asked the locals to recommend a restaurant. They recommended Mariscos Las Palmas on 120th St, which they go all the time. It specializes in seafood, but I saw some vegetarian options on their menu so I went. I ordered a veggie burrito, but when I started eating, I realized that I got fish, due to a misunderstanding. Anyway, I went vegetarian to reduce my carbon footprint and I don’t claim that God absolutely forbids eating meat, so I didn’t complain, especially that the fish burrito was really good.\n\n\n\nMariscos Las Palmas restaurant\n\n\n\n\n\nCrossing Compton Creek on 120th St\n\n\n\n\nSolo adventure of South Central\nThen I began to head back north on Central Ave, to check out some cool places I blew past last December in CicLAvia. While Central isn’t bike friendly, and true, it didn’t feel good to ride on, it didn’t feel too bad either. OK, it’s bad. Just look at how little space I had in the photo below.\n\n\n\nAlmost back at Imperial and then 114th St, where we already rode as a group\n\n\nI stopped by Chuco’s Justice Center at 76th St whose murals I greatly admire, one of which says “Fight for your freedom”. This is an aspect of the vibrancy of poor neighborhoods of color that I like, which I greatly relate to. I also love the rebellious wild type graffiti font, which I find more elegant than aristocratic curly letters, as the former signals solidarity from below while the latter signals snobbery. I used to take regular walks in the rich suburban city San Marino right south of the Caltech campus (even Lincoln Heights feels more like a city; this is probably why “LA” usually does not strictly refer to LA City and I’ll elaborate in another blog post). True, it’s pretty, but nothing is going on, no graffiti, backyard parties, music blaring audible from the street, yard sales, people working on bikes and cars, or kids giving out lemonade that I saw in poorer regions. Also, the security tech signs signaling invisible fences and some actual super elaborate fences guarding obscenely huge mansions made me feel unwelcome.\n\n\n\nChuco mural\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fight for Your Freedom mural I was referring to, not a good photo but it has the necessary info\n\n\nAlong the way, I saw some more murals on Central.\n\n\n\nMural at northeast corner of Central and 76th Place, I think by the same artist as a mural on 1st St near Mariachi Plaza and at the La Canasta restaurant on Whittier Blvd\n\n\nThen I made a detour west on 54th St to see the murals at Dr. Maya Angelou Community High School and another mural that I saw on the Mural Conservancy. Thank you, Mural Conservancy of LA (MCLA), for your great work! I looked at the MCLA website to find murals enroute, and this is one of them, the Wesley United Methodist Church mural at 52nd St and Main, Beacon of Hope. Unfortunately, when I got there, the lower half of the mural was whitewashed, probably because of graffiti. The full mural can be seen on the MCLA website; that’s a precious photo now as the mural is partially lost. Which is why I really should stop to take photos of murals that I like wherever I go, of course when it’s safe to stop, because of the precarious situation murals are in, so if I don’t take a photo now it might no longer be there in my next trip to this region.\nI just finished reading the Murales Rebeldes book, about Chicano murals in LA and Orange Counties, often with rebellious contents, being censored and erased. Most murals featured in the book are no longer extant. Now this mural joined the rank. According to the book, Chicano murals subvert the commodified notion of indivual authorship of art as the murals are often collectively painted by students and community members. Murals document history of local communities of color that may not be otherwise written, and boldly claims public space, not to glorify the powerful as often done by public art, but to inspire rebellion.\n\n\n\nBeacon of Hope, partially whitewashed\n\n\nThere’s a mural around 53rd St and Main:\n\n\n\nMural at northeast corner of 53rd St and Main\n\n\nThen I wonder, is it common for kids here to drop out of school? According to Mapping LA, only 3.4% of people in this neighborhood has a four year college degree, low in the county, and the largest group has less than high school education, high in the county. Is it because of the younger population here or higher rates of dropping out or both? Maybe both, because the data does show younger age, and this mural suggests that dropping out is a problem. If this is true, then the message of the Maya Angelou High School mural really brings me hope. I grew up in schools with messaging of patriotism and obedience, not universal love and justice. I wish that I get these murals in my high school.\nHaving been in school for so long – mostly private school – and still in school now, I have never thought about anywhere where dropping out is common. Then this is one of the strange new worlds with respect to myself, and I don’t have to travel far to get there. Ah, I often don’t look backwards. There’s another mural at this intersection that I found on February 18, so I won’t include that here.\nThen I headed to the Maya Angelou high school. There are actually numerous murals, but I focused on the most prominent one. Here’s a statement by the artist and a much better photo of the mural than mine. I arrived too late for the right sun angle so the mural was in the shade, but I just documented my trip as is. Nor did I have access to a higher viewpoint. From the photo on the artist statement, there used to be murals on the side of the building as well, which are now gone.\n\n\n\nMaya Angelou Rise Above mural\n\n\n\n\n\nZooming into the Maya Angelou quote\n\n\nThen I returned to Central and continued north, seeing more murals along the way. I stopped by Jesus Bike Shop at 49th St, and a mural at 42nd St. That’s a very different kind of bike shop from Incycle which caters to MAMILs. Jesus Bike Shop is really cramped with cruiser and commuter style bikes and rims they use, while Incycle is very spacious and mostly sells high end racing bikes and clothing.\n\n\n\nJesus Bike Shop storefront\n\n\n\n\n\nMural on storefront; I vaguely remember that there were more murals flanking the store last December. If I remember right, then they have been destroyed and I terribly regret for stopping for a photo.\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the store\n\n\nAnother cool mural on 42nd St and Central, La Cultura Cura, which according to Google Translate, means culture heals. It shows the Black Panther, and struggle from the jail most likely signifying the high incarceration rate of Black men. It also depicts a Black hand holding a White hand. Is it in contest of strength, or in friendship to seek healing in the racial divide, or both?\n\n\n\nLa Cultura Cura mural\n\n\n\n\n\nI find the reflection on the car pretty cool. One of the reasons why cars suck is that they take up so much unnecessary space, space that could have been used for affordable housing and community farms, but this time I turned a bug into a feature.\n\n\nFurther north on Central, Cyberpunk DTLA drew close. Cyberpunk indeed, of the high-tech, low life. There’re the skyscrapers housing offices of powerful corporations and new luxury hotels and apartments. Yet I have seen people sleeping on the streets right beneath the skyscrapers. Skid Row is within walking distance away. This part of Central isn’t that far, so the skyscrapers loom above this sketchy neighborhood, like in the Neo-Tokyo song.\n\nThe Neo-Tokyo song says “dreams of a life inside while we escape just to survive”. Though to be honest, I don’t even want to be inside, I mean the institutions signified by the lofty places in the skyscrapers, because I don’t want to become the monster we despise so much and sought to destroy. Our goal is to eliminate the monster, not to become it. Architecture and urban planning are informed by ideology. According to the book Lifted: A Cultural History of the Elevator, the skyscraper is informed by hierarchy, so the physically higher places are higher in hierarchy, opposite to the hierarchical vertical structures prior to the advent of elevators. Burning question: what to do with the existing skyscrapers, and for that matter, freeways, built with hierarchy and segregation in mind, when we achieve an egalitarian and classless society with direct democracy in harmony with nature?\n\n\nEastside\nI took the new 6th St bridge to go to Boyle Heights, to check out the Otomisan Restaurant, a legacy Japanese restaurant, which signifies layers of history of the diverse Boyle Heights, where ethnic minorities who couldn’t live elsewhere lived, though it’s now mostly Latino. The layers of history I see in geographical space makes me wonder, in histological space, if RNA velocity uses unspliced mRNAs to give a glimpse into the future, then what can we use to get a glimpse into the past? There’s lineage tracing, but would something endogenous to the cell tell something about its past?\n\n\n\nOtomisan Restaurant, unfortunately it was closed when I got there.\n\n\nI have been to Eastside many times. To boldly go somewhere I have never gone before: East LA College (ELAC). Because of the continuity in vibe, often I have no idea when I cross neighborhood and city boundaries. I always thought that ELAC is in in unincorporated region of East LA, but it turns out that it’s actually in Monterey Park.\n\n\n\nELAC\n\n\nThe reason why I visited is again Murales Rebeldes, which features a great mural by Roberto Chavez, The Path to Knowledge and the False University, that adorned the facade of the Rosco C. Ingalls Auditorium from 1974 to 1979 when it was whitewashed, disapproved by the administration, as the mural blended in cubist and surrealist styles, not always using typical Chicano styles and icons, and not imposing a single interpretation. Another mural depicting an uncontroversial history of Chicano murals is in the lobby of the auditorium, which I got a glimpse of.\n\n\n\nThe Rosco Auditorium where the mural still sits behind white paint\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mural inside the lobby, with style more typical of Chicano murals; I couldn’t get inside so this is the best I did to take a peek.\n\n\n\n\n\nSculpture at ELAC\n\n\n\n\nMonterey Park\nThen I climbed the Monterey Park hills back to the San Gabriel Valley (SGV). Geography shapes the demography and culture, as the hills (here) and rivers pose transportation challenges. The vibe changes very rapidly as the hill began, from Chicano to Chinese. Somewhat discrete spatial regions are real. Meanwhile, other spatial features, such as weather, change more continuously. To delineate spatial regions, it’s really important to clarify the question asked to find these regions, and which features or variables are relevant and which are not. You see why my favorite weather is when the sky is clearing up but still partially cloudy after rain. When descending north, into the SGV, I got a great view, which was enhanced by the clouds.\n\n\n\nLooking north from Huntington Ave, a little south of Barnes Memorial Park, Monterey Park\n\n\nThe LA County Public Works building in Alhambra is a fine Corporate Modernist landmark from 1971, more info here.\n\n\n\nLooking northwest from that same hill. That teal glass cube is now the LA County Public Works building in Alhambra.\n\n\nOn January 21, I dressed in all black for the Streets Are For Everyone die in, and passed through Monterey Park on the way back. I was already home by 10 pm, and then there was the mass shooting at Star Dance. It was Chinese New Year’s Eve. Did I bring bad luck to the neighborhood because I should really dress in red while black is associated with death and is unlucky for this occasion? Maybe not. I don’t really believe in luck, so any reference to it is figurative. I stopped by Star Dance on Garfield and Garvey. The site was still full of flowers, with a table with incense, in the Buddhist tradition. There were cards and pens to write notes. I wrote in Arabic and English, “we are of God and to Him we return.” I have good intentions, though in the back of my mind I wonder if some Islamophobe would misinterpret it. I also wonder if my act of taking photos would get misinterpreted, as photography is often not allowed in mausoleums. But if I make beautiful and artistic photos, then why not? Because it’s beautiful, I don’t find it disrespectful.\n\n\n\nStar Dance, full of flowers\n\n\n\n\n\nTable with incense to bless the dead\n\n\n\n\nAlhambra\nI have been to Alhambra many times, yet somehow I had never been to the Civic Center and the heart of Downtown. I passed by the City Hall. The other dance studio, Lai Lai, where the shooter was disarmed by witnesses, was across the street from the City Hall. Many city halls have cool architecture (LA City, Pasadena, Downey, Compton, Glendale, Inglewood, and etc.), but I wasn’t impressed by the one in Alhambra (or the one in San Marino, Montebello, Covina, Claremont, and etc.). In terms of architecture (not governance), my favorite city hall thus far is the one of Pasadena. But I like downtown Alhambra, again, the intimate artisan vibe with lively modern businesses occupying historical buildings, those with up to 3 stories and Spanish revival, Art Deco, and vernacular styles so characteristic of LA (looks like mostly vernacular in this photo).\n\n\n\nQuick red light shot. OK, I got a better one when a pedestrian walking, but because autofocus doesn’t work that well in lower light, it’s out of focus. Downtown Alhambra, 1st St and Main St\n\n\nLast time I passed by a Mari Naomi Stop Anti-Asian Hate mural on Alhambra Rd around Electric Ave. This time I made sure to stop for a better look. It’s the same content as the one at Garvey Park, Rosemead, but smaller and rearranged.\n\n\n\nMari Naomi mural in Alhambra\n\n\nBecause I stopped for photos quite often, dusk was drawing near, and the clouds were glowing in the golden hour. I went on a concrete barrier separating out the right lane at Huntington Dr and Garfield Ave. I think one of the advantages of biking or walking is that it’s easy to stop for photos because we don’t take up much space when stopped. Also, being open in the air and traveling slower make us observe our surroundings better.\n\n\n\nLooking east, towards the mountains, at Huntington Dr and Camden Ave\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking west, at the palm tree silhouettes, note the airplane\n\n\n\n\n\nSome 1970s brutalist building\n\n\n\n\nBack to Pasadena\nLast place where I have never gone before: a part of Raymond Hill, where the Raymond Hotel used to be, which gave this hill and the road the name. The hotel caught fire from ember in 1895 and was rebuilt. Later it was eclipsed by the Huntington Hotel and the Great Depression spelled its doom. Historical photos of the first and second Raymond Hotel can be seen here. An apartment building on the hill bears a mural depicting the second Raymond Hotel.\n\n\n\nRaymon Hotel mural on Raymond Hill\n\n\n\n\n\nView from Raymond Hill, looking south. Again, see the LA County Public Works building in Alhambra\n\n\nAs the sun was setting, my trip was coming to a close. And thank you, Wayne Thom! I took inspiration from his CNA Tower photo with the building reflecting the cloud while the background is clear. Now the Art Center building on Raymond Ave was reflecting some clouds and the twilight.\n\n\n\nArt Center at Raymond and Glenarms\n\n\n\n\nEpilogue\nFinally, is it true that “hate has caused a lot of problems in the world, but has not solved one yet”? I haven’t read this sentence in its original context, so here’s just my speculation. I suppose, yes and no. Yes, because in our culture, what we call “hate” often has a power dynamic, of a dominant group oppressing a less dominant one, and is often associated with discrimination based on certain characteristics. Oppression, inherently unjust, only causes problems and doesn’t solve any. At a smaller scale, hate also often originates from egotistical envy and arrogance. No, because how about hating injustice and the system and institutions that perpetuate injustice? Certain things are justifiably hated, but nor is it pure hate, because we hate injustice because we love justice. In contrast, the kind of sinful hate may seem to be motivated by some kind of love, such as nationalism and tribalism, but that’s neither true love nor love of truth, but parochial and egotistical envy."

And there are two versions of lyrics. Cool and ethical are different concepts. I find many things cool but unethical, such as pretty much everything aerospace designed by and for the military industrial complex. Also, while I can’t help but find jetliners cool and I enjoy flying, especially the thrill of acceleration when taking off and the view from above, I try not to fly because it’s bad for the environment. So LA International Airport, where the big jet engines roar, says the first version of the LAX song. Cool, I like that song.

On the other hand, when I visited, I found it a great feat of engineering and a nice park where many people and birds enjoy.\n\n\n\nTouchdown. What an apposite road name! Though as a nerd, I don’t care about football whatsoever. I don’t even care that much about competitive cycling. Again, LAX.\n\n\nLove. Really? I don’t think gentrification is an expression of love. Yesterday, I listened to this online interview on love in the Islamic tradition. In short, in the pre-colonial era, love was central to Islam and what we now call Sufism was mainstream Islam. That Islam is an arid legalistic orthopraxy is a colonial construct, and our colonial overlords want Wahhabism, which fits that description, to become orthodox, so as a result, many Muslims today say Sufism is haram. Colonialism, White Man’s Duty, claims to spread love, liberty, and justice, but does anything but. The hypocrisy led many people today to lose faith in those ideals. So in Khaled About El Fadl’s law school class at UCLA, 99% of students these days no longer believe that justice is possible. I feel like this sign saying “love” looks like commodifying and hence making a mockery of love. I mean by commodify when we pretend that love is represented by items that can be bought and sold. Otherwise don’t displace the poor. In late capitalism, what isn’t a commodity?\n\n\n\nFirst glimpse of the lake\n\n\nYet I somehow found this place cool. It’s designed to look beautiful. A central theme of this trip is cool but unethical.\n\n\nThe parking lots are larger than the stadium itself. Again, cars suck because they take up so much unnecessary space, to the point of driving up rent. Imagine how many people such space can house and how much food we can grow once we abolish car culture. Across a parking lot is the Kia Forum, whose building I find cool.\n\n\n\nKia Forum"

    "text": "In v1, I wrote often lengthy descriptions of the voyage and thoughts from the voyage in the Strava description field of each activity, which I call Captain’s Log. I’ll explain my quirky terminology in another blog post. I also put photos there. However, I can’t run R code there, and adding references is more difficult, since Strava’s description isn’t really meant for my kind of Aspie overthinking about the activities. I had a blog before, made with blogdown, but I haven’t touched it for over 3 years, in part because I don’t have the web development expertise to deal with the 3rd party theme and over time I got more and more security alerts from GitHub urging me to update the dependencies, and I got some breaking changes. Eventually I decided to revive my blog here with Quarto, because from my experiences with pkgdown R package documentation websites based on bootswatch themes, I find the bootswatch themes much easier to deal with without web development experiences. Furthermore, my Captain’s Logs are often the length of blog posts, so I already have a de facto blog on Strava. So here we go, this is my Captain’s Log for today’s voyage:\n\n\n\n\nI didn’t bring my real camera, because initially I intended to do C++ style to save some time. However, I couldn’t resist my inner useR; I couldn’t help but stopped for photos. Why waste the opportunity when it’s so beautiful out there? So I took some photos with my phone. Anyway, with to many stop signs and turns, because I want to (not so) boldly go into the nooks and crannies I have never gone before, it’s impossible to ride hard and fast all the time C++ style. Why not soak in the scenery?\nFirst new addition to my Hall of Fame: W Montecito Ave, between Michilinda Ave to the west and Lima St to the east, in Sierra Madre. I enjoyed the solitude and the flower scent, presumably from those little white flowers. I really can’t decide what my favorite region of LA is, because they are so different. While I like this quiet and posh area, it doesn’t have the edge of Boyle Heights.\n\n\n\nW Montecito Ave, Sierra Madre\n\n\nNext I rode through the periphery of downtown Sierra Madre, then to the heart of Monrovia on Myrtle Ave, climbing all the way to the top, through the posh and seemingly quite new neighborhood called Gold Hills. That’s a wall, much of which is over 17%. I was gasping for air. In the last 13% steep part, after the worse 17% wall, I got a strong headwind coming from above, making the climb more challenging. Indeed with hardship comes ease! There isn’t really a spectacular view near the top. The cool part is just recognizing familiar places from afar, such as the Santa Fe Dam to the east, and Monrovia High School, which I just passed, to the southeast. I didn’t stop at the top but immediately descended.\nWhich brought me to the next new addition to my Hall of Fame, as if one turn led me into another world, which is why I’m fascinated with negative spatial autocorrelation: N Hidden Valley Rd, for its quiet greenery of wilderness.\n\n\n\nN Alta Vista Rd, Monrovia\n\n\nLook at the clouds! That’s what I mean when I say “watercolor sky”. The white tower in the mid lower left of the photo below should be Monrovia High School. The steep switchback descent soon after this spot isn’t easy. I would like to climb this part in a another trip. It’s steep and hence challenging, but I get to spend more time in this awesome view.\n\n\n\nA little down N Alta Vista Ave Rd\n\n\nThe wind was getting stronger. Fortunately I didn’t pump up the tires, as the part of Huntington Dr in the heart of Arcadia was wet. It must have rained earlier when I was indoors, and I felt a few drops of rain during this ride.\nIt’s been a while since I last visited the LA County Arboretum area. The last trip was in September 2021, before my first group ride with the Women on Wheels (WoW) group of the Pasadena Athletic Association (PAA). I just bought Voyager early September, 2021. I rode my commuter bike, Enterprise, to the Arboretum, to visit the Santa Anita Park and the Arboretum. That area is not bike friendly. I don’t really dare to ride on that part of Baldwin Ave, and there was no bike rack, so I had to lock up Enterprise on a sign, which is not best practice since it’s easier to break the thin perforated metal pole of the sign than a real bike rack, as the pole is meant to break when hit by a car. I had to walk quite a bit into the Santa Anita Park, by the shopping mall and vast parking lots, as I read on the park’s website that bikes weren’t allowed inside. But I had a nice trip, since that was my first time watching racing horses galloping and I love the Art Deco building of the facility. That said, there have been animal cruelty scandals in horse racing.\nI coined the term “cyborg jockey” to refer to cyclists, because of the Victorian “mechanical horse” expression to refer to a bike, and because I wondered if the best racing horse raced the best human time trialist, who would win? The answer is the human cyborg jockey. The Guiness World Record of horse speed, over 402 meters, is 43.97 mph. The human powered speed record on a flat course without drafting, over 200 meters, is 89.59 mph, achieved in a fully faired recumbent bike. While the human speed record is over a shorter distance, I’m sure that the rider must have been much faster than 50 mph soon before and after the 200 m flying start time trial, so I think the human wins. I went there the morning before that group ride because I’m a night owl and I’m not used to getting up so early for the group ride, so I would spend more time in the sunshine to hack my circadian rhythm.\nAnyway, enough of 2021 digression about this location. I rode on Hugo Reid Dr south of the Arboretum. Again, many peacocks. They were introduced by Elias “Lucky” Baldwin in the 1880s, founder of City of Arcadia, from India, and have remained since. Sometimes I even see them in Pasadena and San Marino. And why Hugo Reid Dr? Because long before Arcadia was incorporated in 1903, and when California was part of Mexico, Hugo Reid was awarded Rancho Santa Anita in 1841. Hugo Reid married Tongva widow Victoria Reid, and wrote about the Tongva in his letters to Los Angeles Star, which to this day are precious resources on pre-colonial Tongva.\n\n\n\nOn Hugo Reid Dr, Arcadia, with peacocks on the lawn\n\n\nThen back to Pasadena. According to my Strava personal heatmap, southeast Pasadena and unincorporated East Pasadena are underexplored, so I went there on purpose.\n\n\n\nRose Villa St and Allen Ave, Pasadena\n\n\nThe watercolor cloud was southeast of Pasadena, behind the palm trees in the photo below. I looked back at it from Pasadena Community College (PCC).\n\n\n\nPCC parking lot on Hill Ave\n\n\nIn the earlier photo from the Monrovia foothill, the clouds were above the mountains. The strong wind from the north blew the clouds away from the mountains.\n\n\n\nMountains now clear, from PCC\n\n\nIf I learnt anything from English classes, it is “show, don’t tell”. Now behold the wind blowing the palm trees, as I was riding on Cordova to the west. I felt like flying an airplane in turbulence, but Voyager doesn’t have seat belts.\n\n\n\nCordova, almost to Lake Ave\n\n\nThat’s it for the trip. I’ll continue writing the R package Voyager."

The dashed line is sqrt(.Machine$double.eps), around 1.5e-8, so while the magnitude of the difference may not seem great, it’s greater than can be accounted for by machine precision although much smaller than when the Seurat scaled data is clipped. Seurat uses implicitly restarted Lanczos bidiagonalization algorithm (IRLBA) for PCA, which performs approximate singular value decomposition (SVD) and is much faster and memory efficient than base R prcomp(), while Scanpy by default uses ARPACK, which also uses the implicitly restarted Lanczos method for symmetric matrices. That this method computes approximate SVD might be responsible for the discrepancy."

    "text": "Captain’s Log, stardate 100753.94, Earth date February 26, 2023, though it took me weeks to finish writing it.\nLA got a blizzard warning, the first time since 1989, as the cold storm came on Thursday, February 23. I was in my office and saw hail bouncing off the metal strip beneath the window. Friday saw an entire day of heavy rain, hence grouding starship Voyager. The rain became lighter on Saturday, but still lasted until the night. The rain forced me to rest and recover. In other words, get more work done. Internet feels like oxygen these days. The storm on Friday night caused a wifi outage. Not wanting to ride in the rain, I stayed at home on Saturday. What to do without wifi? Life continued. I read papers I had already downloaded and wrote some code. My impulse to check Mastodon and search random stuff was foregrounded and checked – I lived without it totally fine. I could better focus. Today, the rain stopped and the sun came out, though the forecast says that the rain will resume next Monday to Wednesday. As if God bless CicLAvia, in the Valley, from Reseda to Canoga Park.\nI mean, the other valley:\nThe San Fernando Valley (SFV), which had its own mission and a distinctive dialect of the Tataviam people, mutually intelligible with the Tongva language elsewhere in LA. It was the mission that gave rise to a unified Tongva/Gabrieleno identity, as many modern members trace their lineages from the San Gabriel Mission. The SFV had the Mission San Fernando Rey de España. I wonder whether SFV’s mission led to a distinctive Tataviam identity today, as I’m pretty sure that Tongva people from so called SGV and those from so called South Bay spoke somewhat different dialects.\nThough apparently not everyone agrees that Pasadena is in the San Gabriel Valley (SGV), probably because the Raymond Dyke fault separates Pasadena (actually also Sierra Madre and Aradia north of Huntington Dr) from the rest of the SGV, forming the hills in San Marino and between Pasadena and South Pasadena. Mapping LA considers Pasadena part of the Verdugos rather than SGV. Since “SFV” is reminiscent of the acronym of my R package SpatialFeatureExperiment (SFE), I thought about giving this blog the name SpatialGenomicValley (SGV), but the current name was more popular among those I asked."

I saw a great photo of the mural reflected in the water below at the LA Public Library and wanted to reproduce it, with the soft morning light. However, that didn’t work because the water was flowing too fast and with too many wavelets to form a visible reflection of the mural.

Behold the lowrider in action.\n\n\n\n\n\nCavaretta’s Italian Deli\n\n\nAfter spending some time at the Canoga Park hub, where I got to sample some different bike cultures, I left the route at Owensmouth and headed to my own adventure, to ride on as much of LA River bike paths as possible.\n\n\n\nHeading to the last pedestrian zone, Canoga Park\n\n\n\n\n\nBMX? I thought BMX bikes would be shorter, but these bikes have BMX handlebars.\n\n\n\n\n\nCicLAvia map and more from the BMX culture, which I don’t know much about and I was too shy to talk to those people.\n\n\n\n\n\nBMX again? Also note the flooded road. This was a blessed opening in the midst of storm.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust to document\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial tandem cruiser bike and special Metro Art Bus. Caveat: how well can passengers see out of that bus?\n\n\n\n\n\nSomeone must be really obsessed with Coca Cola. BTW, it’s unthinkable how much sugar there is in those drinks consumed by sedentary people. They are sweeter than my sports drinks which I only drink for at least tempo efforts when I begin to burn more glycogen. That’s how unhealthy those sugary drinks are.\n\n\n\n\n\nBike mechanic fixing a flat at Canoga Park Hub\n\n\nI made a U turn and made a right on Owensmouth to depart CicLAvia, leading to LA River. BTW, this is the most upstream place where LA River is called LA River. Further upstream, in the Santa Monica Mountains, there are Arroyo Calabassas and Bell Breek.\n\n\n\nCool mural of Canoga Park Florist on Owensmouth\n\n\n\n\n\nThis part of Owensmouth south of Sherman Way was also at least in part closed to cars, looking south towards Woodland Hills.\n\n\nPhotography lessons learnt: I made mistakes and learn from mistakes. Number one, one thing CicLAvia taught me is that it turns out that shooting environmental portraits is fun. Which I totally didn’t expect given that I’m introverted and don’t like talking to strangers. Still no courage to get strangers to pose though. Here’s how it got started: Last December, I went to Samy’s Camera in Pasadena for Mark Edward Harris’s class on travel photography, which happened to be free as part of Nikon Day. He talked about environmental portraits as part of the photo essay about a place, such as LA. He also said that it would not be possible to do a photo essay of a place that is too complex, which I totally agree, but I disagree with him that LA is simple enough to be able to be well-represented in a photo essay. The next day, I tried to practice what I learnt in CicLAvia, and tried to take an environmental portrait of a bike mechanic at the Exposition Park hub, and of a family playing giant chess.\nMy greatest cycling achievement is that it helped me to overcome years of social anxiety, because the aerobic exercise induced endorphin made me less nervous and over time the evidence built up that talking to people isn’t scary. It didn’t make me extraverted, but it did make me less scared of talking to people. Also, probably especially because LA is so bike unfriendly, cyclists tend to be nice to each other. At least for us Lycra road warriors, we culturally greet each other on the road even if we don’t know each other, as if saying, “Hey, we have the same mental illness.” In contrast, when I went to more bike friendly cities such as Seattle, Portland, Sacramento, and Davis, there were so many cyclists that nobody thinks twice, so we generally didn’t greet each other.\nSo long story short, I got opened up to people and find it fun to take photos of them, especially when it comes to different aspects of cycling culture. When learning photography, I prioritized landscape and city, since presumably that’s what I expect in my voyages; generally I want the entire scene to be sharp, so smaller apertures and polarizing filter. This time I found out that my go to travel lens – a lightweight and versatile Panasonic G Vario 12-60 mm zoom lens for micro four thirds (I chose MFT because it and its lenses are smaller so easier for me to carry when climbing thousands of feet in one trip) – doesn’t have large enough an aperture to make that nice background blur. I was already using the largest aperture I had for the focal length and it couldn’t create enough of a background blur which would make those portraits nicer (f/3.5 and gets smaller as I zoom in so it kind of limits how shallow the depth of field I can get even if I compress the scene by standing back and zooming all the way in). So time to burn some money on some f/1.8 portrait lenses, second hand of course. While MAMILs are notorious for burning money on cycling gear, I find that photography gear gets really expensive much more quickly than cycling gear, so buying new with the bit of grad school stipend I saved by not flying, not driving, and not eating out is unthinkable. I suppose if with better photos, I can make cycling in LA look cool and change the way people think about LA so we can better work towards green transport and Vision Zero, then the few hundred bucks for the lenses are worth it.\nNumber two, I got to befriend shutter priority and burst mode. I made a mistake of not setting fast enough a shutter speed. While 1/250 second is good enough for cyclists further away and pedestrians, it’s too slow for cyclists that are closer, so I got a blurry shot that otherwise has great composition (not shown here) which I kept on my external HD as a record. I really should use 1/1000. Somehow I found that crazy fast, probably because I often use a polarizing filter and smaller aperture for landscape shots (actually f/8 rather than the conventional f/16 most of time as that’s the sharpest for my MFT lenses), leading to slower shutter speed, which makes me think 1/250 is fast enough.\nNumber three, I made a really dumb mistake that ruined an otherwise nice portrait in Canoga Park of BMX riders – I focused the wrong area, and given that I used the largest aperture I had, intending to blur out the background with shallower depth of field, the riders got blurry. Then I just realized that my camera has a face priority mode that would automatically focus on detected faces. The riders are generally really happy and cooperative with me taking photos of them. It’s not that awkward.\nNumber four, I made the merger mistake again and didn’t realize until I looked at my photos at home on my laptop, but it’s so hard to avoid all mergers when there are so many things in the background. Be more careful next time, and burst mode might help. Also, I wonder how pros get all the settings ready in a changing situation so they don’t miss the shot by the time they’re done with the settings. I suppose for the next CicLAvia in April, I’ll change to a portrait lens and get the settings ready before I enter the first pedestrian zone."

One in Encino, within the Sepulveda Basin recreation area grouped together with baseball fields, and another in Carson, the only Olympic grade indoor velodrome in North America. While the Carson velodrome is deemed cool and hosts world championships and plans to host track cycling races in the 2028 Olympics, the Encino velodrome struggles to keep up with maintenance. Classes at the Encino velodrome are also much cheaper than those at the Carson velodrome. Last time, in December 2021, I visited the Encino Velodrome, which was closed. This time I visited again to see if I had any luck to enter it. No, no luck. I wonder if it would only open during its classes. Or maybe it closed because of the rain, which may make the track slippery and unsafe for riding. Anyway, I peeked inside and took some photos.\n\n\n\nOlympic rings on the concrete track of the Encino velodrome. The red (black in Carson) line is the pole or sprinter’s line, for hard efforts when training, and blue line above is the relief line, for tempo efforts and for relief in Madison races. This track isn’t as steep as the on in Carson, where it takes me threshold effort just not to slip down when riding above the blue line especially that I have to go up and down on that line. So Encino is probably more suitable for us mortals, while the Carson velodrome is for Olympians.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the dilapidated parking lot of the Encino velodrome\n\n\nAfter the velodrome, I continued on the south side of the basin, and saw a memorial of someone hit and killed by a car around the golf course.\n\n\n\nThe memorial for Noe.

Somehow I wasn’t thinking that I planned to go to some dirt trail this time, as I initially planned this part of the route a long time ago. The tunnel leading to the dam was flooded, and lined with graffiti, to my delight.\n\n\n\nGraffiti in the tunnel towards the inside of the dam, the water was still a little disturbed from me riding there, hoping to wash off a little mud.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking into the dam\n\n\nAt some point, so much mud was caught between Voyager’s rear wheel and the frame that the wheel couldn’t turn, so I effectively dragged Voyager around in the mud. Nevertheless, I was determined to get to where LA River exits the dam. While my pants and shoes got very muddy, my camera was mostly spared, though mud kind of clogged up the rotating mechanism of my polarizing filter.\n\n\n\nInside the dam\n\n\n\n\n\nSeeing the dam\n\n\nI felt so relieved when I got to the ramp leading to the dam top, finally away from the mud. The dam top is paved, though not really a bike path like on Santa Fe, Hansen, and Whittier Narrows dams. I saw an old photo at the LA Public Library of cat faces painted on the flood outlet caps at Sepulveda Dam. It might be on the other side, so I walked down a grass slope to the other side of the dam, to the south, where someone was riding a motorcycle.\n\n\n\nDam top and snowy peaks in the distance"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Due to the large number of genes quantified in single cell and spatial transcriptomics, dimension reduction is part of the standard workflow to analyze such data, to visualize, to help interpreting the data, to distill relevant information and reduce noise, to facilitate downstream analyses such as clustering and pseudotime, to project different samples into a shared latent space for data integration, and so on.\nThe first dimension reduction methods we learn about, such as good old principal component analysis (PCA), tSNE, and UMAP, don’t use spatial information. With the rise of spatial transcriptomics, some dimension reduction methods that take spatial dependence into account have been written. Some, such as SpatialPCA (Shang and Zhou 2022), NSF (Townes and Engelhardt 2023), and MEFISTO (Velten et al. 2022) use factor analysis or probabilistic PCA which is related to factor analysis, and model the factors as Gaussian processes, with a spatial kernel for the covariance matrix, so the factors have positive spatial autocorrelation and can be used for downstream clustering where the clusters can be more spatially coherent. Some use graph convolution networks on a spatial neighborhood graph to find spatially informed embeddings of the cells, such as conST (Zong et al. 2022) and SpaceFlow (Ren et al. 2022). SpaSRL (Zhang et al. 2023) finds a low dimension projection of spatial neighborhood augmented data.\nSpatially informed dimension reduction is actually not new, and dates back to at least 1985, with Wartenberg’s crossover of Moran’s I and PCA (Wartenberg 1985), which was generalized and further developed as MULTISPATI PCA (Dray, Saı̈d, and Débias 2008), implemented in the adespatial package on CRAN. In short, while PCA tries to maximize the variance explained by each PC, MULTISPATI maximizes the product of Moran’s I and variance explained. Also, while all the eigenvalues from PCA are non-negative, because the covariance matrix is positive semidefinite, MULTISPATI can give negative eigenvalues, which represent negative spatial autocorrelation, which can be present and interesting but is not as common as positive spatial autocorrelation and is often masked by the latter (Griffith 2019).\nIn single cell -omics conventions, let \\(X\\) denote a gene count matrix whose columns are cells or Visium spots and whose rows are genes, with \\(n\\) columns. Let \\(W\\) denote the row normalized \\(n\\times n\\) adjacency matrix of the spatial neighborhood graph of the cells or Visium spots, which does not have to be symmetric. MULTISPATI diagonalizes a symmetric matrix\n\\[\nH = \\frac 1 {2n} X(W^t+W)X^t\n\\]\nHowever, the implementation in adespatial is more general and can be used for other multivariate analyses in the duality diagram paradigm, such as correspondence analysis; the equation above is simplified just for PCA, without having to introduce the duality diagram here.\nIn this blog post, I use adespatial to run MULTISPATI PCA, compare the results to those of non-spatial PCA, and in Part 2 of the post, try a faster implementation using RSpectra. The faster implementation will be added to the next release of Voyager in Bioconductor 3.17 in May. This will be the first multivariate spatial analysis method in Voyager, as the implementation is straightforward and all packages required are on CRAN or Bioconductor. This blog post itself will be edited to become a new vignette. I’m writing it here in the process to think before I code. So the code here isn’t meant to remain runnable in the future after the next release comes out, because the user interface of devel functions in Voyager can change in the next few weeks.\nHere we load the packages:\n\nlibrary(ade4)\nlibrary(adespatial)\nlibrary(SFEData)\nlibrary(scater)\nlibrary(scran)\nlibrary(Voyager)\nlibrary(sparseMatrixStats)\nlibrary(SingleCellExperiment)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(bluster)\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\n\nThe development version of Voyager is used here, and I will note code that doesn’t work with the current release version in Bioconductor 3.16. In Bioconductor version numbering conventions, an odd minor version number (the second number) means devel.\n\npackageVersion(\"Voyager\")\n\n[1] '1.1.10'"

Clusters are supposed to be groups of different spots that are more similar within a group, sharing some characteristics. Non-spatial and MULTISPATI PCA use different characteristics for the clustering. Non-spatial PCA finds genes that are good for telling cell types apart, although those genes may happen to be very spatially structured. Non-spatial clustering aims to find these groups only from gene expression, and cells with similar gene expression can be surrounded by cells of other types in histological space. This is just like mapping Art Deco buildings, which are often near Spanish revival and Beaux Art buildings whose styles are quite different and perform different functions, thus not necessarily forming a coherent spatial region.\nIn contrast, MULTISPATI’s positive components find genes that must characterize spatial regions in addition to distinguishing between different cell types. Which genes are involved in each MULTISPATI component may be as interesting as the clusters. It would be interesting to perform gene set enrichment analysis, or to interpret this as some sort of spatial patterns of spatially variable genes. This is like mapping when the buildings were built, so Art Deco, Spanish revival, Beaux Art popular in the 1920s and 1930s will end up in the same cluster and form a more spatially coherent region, which can be found in DTLA Historical Core and Jewelry District, and Old Pasadena. Hence non-spatial clustering of spatial data isn’t necessarily bad. Rather, it tells a different story and reveals different aspects of the data from spatial clustering."

    "text": "Smaller scale clusters\nSpatial regions can come in hierarchies. In geographical space, using an example familiar to me from the voyages of starship Voyager, this can be Southern California (SoCal) at a higher level, defined by culture and climate, followed by the metropolitan region of LA and Orange Counties (OC) and perhaps urgan regions of western San Bernardino County, followed by different regions of LA County such as Eastside, Westside, South Bay, Harbor Cities, South LA, Central LA, San Fernando Valley (SFV), Northeast LA, San Gabriel Valley (SGV), Pomona Valley, Angeles National Forest, Antelope Valley, Santa Monica Mountains, and etc., followed by neighborhoods and small cities within those regions, such as Boyle Heights, Highland Park, Mt Washington, Westwood, and etc. which in practice are similar in scale and function to most smaller cities like San Marino, Beverly Hills, Culver City, Arcadia, San Gabriel, and etc., each of which have sub-regions.\nSuppose we perform MULTISPATI PCA on LA County, not really quantitatively, just based on my own familiarity and types of interactions with these places. I think PC1 would separate the wilderness of Angeles National Forest, Santa Monica Mountains, Griffith Park, much of San Rafael Hills, and much of Puente hills from the urban and suburban regions. PC2 might separate the mostly Black and Hispanic regions that are usually less affluent such as Eastside, South LA, and NELA, from affluent mostly White and sometimes Asian regions like Westside, South Bay, Beverly Hills, southern SFV, northern SGV, La Canada Flintridge, and etc. but it might not distinguish between different Latino regions such as Highland Park and El Sereno. PC2 and PC3 may also pick up the Asian regions in much of the SGV and in Koreatown. Subsequent PCs may pick up some industrial regions, such as Arts District, Vernon, City of Industry, Carson, Wilmington, and perhaps smaller racialized regions, such as those within Pasadena and DTLA, different vibes of neighborhoods with similar socioeconomic status, mini-downtowns of neighborhoods, smaller but very distinct regions such as the Aerospace Corridor near LAX, and architectural styles from different eras.\nClustering with the first few PCs will give you Angeles National Forest, Eastside, Westside, and etc., which might not answer a specific question about LA, such as different types of Latino neighborhoods, redistricting Pasadena, and different ecosystems within the Angeles National Forest. These questions would benefit from the “later” PCs with smaller length scales of spatial autocorrelation. Another moral of this thought experiment is that the PCs that explain a smaller percentage of variance aren’t necessarily uninteresting. That something else shows a more drastic difference doesn’t mean that smaller differences are irrelevant. I personally find these more local differences very interesting. However, those unfamiliar with the region won’t ask these questions to begin with. Moral: as a bioinformatician not specialized in any particular tissue or disease, each of which seems to be its own field of study, I desperately need the help of experts in those tissues and diseases to make sense of data. I might not be using the most relevant way to find spatial regions when it comes to the more relevant questions about those tissues and diseases.\nAnyway, biological interpretations aside, what if we cluster with MULTISPATI components with shorter length scales of spatial autocorrelation?\nFirst, what do those components look like?\n\nspatialReducedDim(sfe, \"multispati\", ncomponents = 9:30, \n                  divergent = TRUE, diverge_center = 0, ncol = 6)\n\n\n\n\nAlso plot top gene loadings for some of these MULTISPATI components:\n\nplotDimLoadings(sfe, dims = 8:13, reduction = \"multispati\", \n                swap_rownames = \"symbol\", ncol = 3)\n\n\n\n\nSome genes with high loading in these “later” components are known to be involved in muscle regeneration, such as Myog, Xirp1, and Cxcl9, and potentially Bicd2, Csrp3, and Nek6. The slingshot package performs pseudotime analysis on any dimension reduction. It would be interesting to see what if we perform pseudotime analysis on MULTISPATI rather than non-spatial PCA, with the later two timepoints and more biological replica. This dataset comes from the first time point after notexin injury, and this study only has one biological replicate per time point.\nThese components tend to highlight heterogeneity within the leukocyte infiltrated injury region when plotting the embeddings in space, which is consistent with the muscle regeneration genes with high. This seems to be the case, based on visual inspection, for CS8 and later. What if I only use CS8 and later components for clustering?\n\nset.seed(29)\nsfe$clusts_multispati2 <- clusterRows(reducedDim(sfe, \"multispati\")[,8:30],\n                                     BLUSPARAM = NNGraphParam(\n                                          cluster.fun = \"leiden\",\n                                          cluster.args = list(\n                                              objective_function = \"modularity\",\n                                              resolution_parameter = 1\n                                          )\n                                      ))\n\nHere’s the H&E image for reference: \n\np1 <- plotSpatialFeature(sfe, \"clusts_multispati2\") +\n    ggtitle(\"CS8-30\")\np2 <- plotSpatialFeature(sfe, \"clusts_multispati\") +\n    ggtitle(\"CS1-30\")\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\nIt seems that when using all of the top 30 PCs from MULTISPATI, while PC1 by far explains much more variance than other PCs, the heterogeneity from the later PCs is not all overwhelmed and lost. When using only 8-30, perhaps due to the shorter length scale of spatial autocorrelation, the clusters are less spatially contiguous, and there are smaller, more local clusters such as clusters 5 and 6 that might mark distinct muscle regions adjacent to the injury region."

    "title": "A faster implementation of MULTISPATI PCA",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Last time, I used the implementation of MULTISPATI PCA in adespatial on the mouse skeletal muscle Visium dataset. The dataset is small by scRNA-seq standards, with only 900 something spots. It too about half a minute to run MULTISPATI PCA, to obtain 30 PCs with the most positive eigenvalues and 30 with the most negative eigenvalues. It might not sound too bad, but it only took less than one second to run non-spatial PCA with the IRLBA algorithm to obtain 30 PCs.\nThe adespatial implementation is slow because it performs full spectrum decomposition twice, with base R’s eigen() function. The first is to perform non-spatial PCA, whose output contains row and column weights and the original data that are then used by the multispati() function. The second time is for the spatially weighted covariance matrix in multispati(). Although only the top 30 positive and negative eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors are retained in the results, all the 900 something eigenvalues and eigenvector were computed, doing a lot of unnecessary work.\nI would like to perform MULTISPATI PCA on single cell resolution datasets with over 100,000 cells, so I need a more efficient implementation, which is what I do here.\nHere we load the packages.

Uncertainties in cell segmentation means that cell segmentation polygon contiguity might have many false negatives so a polygon contiguity graph may miss many actual neighbors. Hence we use the k nearest neighbor method to find a spatial neighborhood graph, with \\(k = 5\\), which appears reasonable from visual inspections. Furthermore, k nearest neighbor is more scalable to larger datasets compared to some other methods such as triangulation following by edge pruning. The devel (Bioconductor 3.17) version of SpatialFeatureExperiment can find k nearest neighbors much more efficiently than the release (Bioconductor 3.16) version. Inverse distance weighting is used so neighbors further away have less contribution, and the weighted spatial neighborhood adjacency matrix is row normalized as is customary for MULTISPATI and default in spdep so the spatially lagged values are comparable to the original values.\n\ncolGraph(sfe_sub, \"knn\") <- findSpatialNeighbors(sfe_sub, method = \"knearneigh\", \n                                                 k = 5, dist_type = \"idw\", \n                                                 style = \"W\")\n\nHere we plot the spatial neighborhood graph, where transparency of the edges corresponds to edge weight:\n\nplotColGraph(sfe_sub, \"knn\", colGeometryName = \"centroids\", weights = TRUE) +\n    theme_void()\n\n\n\n\nWrapping everything needed to get MULTISPATI results from adespatial ready to be added to reducedDims(sfe_sub) in one function:\n\ncalc_multispati_ade <- function(sfe, colGraphName, nfposi = 30, nfnega = 30) {\n    df <- logcounts(sfe) |> # Don't need highly variable genes here\n        as.matrix() |> t() |> \n        as.data.frame()\n    pca <- dudi.pca(df, scannf = FALSE, nf = nfposi) # scales data by default\n    multispati_res <- multispati(pca, colGraph(sfe, colGraphName), scannf = FALSE,\n                             nfposi = nfposi, nfnega = nfnega)\n    multispati_mat <- as.matrix(multispati_res$li)\n    rownames(multispati_mat) <- colnames(sfe)\n    loadings <- as.matrix(multispati_res$c1)\n    rownames(loadings) <- rownames(sfe)\n    colnames(loadings) <- str_replace(colnames(loadings), \"CS\", \"PC\")\n    attr(multispati_mat, \"rotation\") <- loadings\n    attr(multispati_mat, \"eig\") <- multispati_res$eig\n    multispati_mat\n}\n\nHere I use profvis to profile the code, to see the time and memory taken by each function called:\n\nprofvis({ade_res <- calc_multispati_ade(sfe_sub, \"knn\")})\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis usually takes from 50 seconds to about a minute and 200 to 300 something MB of RAM on my lab’s server where R does NOT use an optimized BLAS (the results would be slightly different every time I run it). According to the profile, the vast majority of time was spent on eigen(), which was called twice and performed the full eigen decomposition, although only a small subset of eigenvectors are retained in the results.\nI ran the same code on my laptop which uses the optimized Apple vecLib BLAS. My laptop is a 2017 MacBook Pro with 8 GB of RAM and 2 physical CPU cores. The adespatial implementation took 390 ms (eigen() used 30 ms) and 257.5 MB of RAM. Using an optimized BLAS drastically speeds up matrix operations. See this page for instructions on changing to an optimized BLAS in Ubuntu. For Fedora, it’s possible to change BLAS without leaving the R session with flexiblas. For Mac, R 4.2 comes with vecLib so you no longer have to locate the vecLib from the system. Here’s the official instruction for Mac to make R use vecLib. Unfortunately, from my online search as I don’t personally use Windows, there is no better option than Microsoft R Open for Windows.\nHere is my implementation of MULTISPATI, with everything I can do to improve efficiency I can think of. In the spdep package, the listw2mat() function converts a listw spatial neighborhood graph object into an adjacency matrix, but it’s a dense matrix with mostly 0’s, so using a sparse matrix will save memory.\n\n# Convert listw to sparse matrix to save memory\nlistw2sparse <- function(listw) {\n    i <- rep(seq_along(listw$neighbours), times = card(listw$neighbours))\n    j <- unlist(listw$neighbours)\n    x <- unlist(listw$weights)\n    sparseMatrix(i = i, j = j, x = x)\n}\n\nThen wrap everything needed to get MULTISPATI results ready to be added to reducedDims(sfe_sub) in one function:\n\n# nf positive and negative eigenvalues\ncalc_multispati_rspectra <- function(sfe, colGraphName, nf = 30) {\n    # Scaled matrix is no longer sparse\n    X <- as.matrix(t(logcounts(sfe)))\n    X <- sweep(X, 2, colMeans(X))\n    # Note that dudi.pca divides by n instead of n-1 when scaling data\n    n <- nrow(X)\n    X <- sweep(X, 2, sqrt(colVars(X)*(n-1)/n), FUN = \"/\")\n    W <- listw2sparse(colGraph(sfe, colGraphName))\n    mid <- W + t(W)\n    covar <- t(X) %*% mid %*% X / (2*nrow(X))\n    res <- eigs_sym(covar, k = nf * 2, which = \"BE\")\n    loadings <- res$vectors\n    out <- X %*% loadings\n    colnames(out) <- paste0(\"PC\", seq_len(ncol(out)))\n    attr(out, \"rotation\") <- loadings\n    attr(out, \"eig\") <- res$values\n    out\n}\n\nI noted that ade4::dudi.pca(), whose output is used in multispati(), divides by n when computing the variance when scaling the data. This is the maximum likelihood estimate, while dividing by n-1 is the unbiased estimate. Shall I use n or n-1? For the typical size of spatial transcriptomics data, this shouldn’t cause very much of a difference\nAgain, I profile this run:\n\nprofvis({rsp_res <- calc_multispati_rspectra(sfe_sub, \"knn\")})\n\n\n\n\n\nThis usually takes 500 something ms and around 40 MB of RAM, without optimized BLAS. It is indeed much faster than the adespatial implementation, over 80 times faster. Much of the time was spent on matrix multiplication. On my laptop with vecLib, this took 90 ms and 42.5 MB of RAM, over 4 times faster than the adespatial implementation run with vecLib. Using vecLib does not reduce memory usage.\nNow check if the results are the same:\n\n# Eigenvalues\nall.equal(head(attr(rsp_res, \"eig\"), 30), head(attr(ade_res, \"eig\"), 30))\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nall.equal(tail(attr(rsp_res, \"eig\"), 30), tail(attr(ade_res, \"eig\"), 30))\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nSo the eigenvalues are the same. Plot the eigenvalues:\n\nplot(attr(rsp_res, \"eig\"), ylab = \"Eigenvalue\")\n\n\n\n\nNote that unlike in non-spatial PCA, the eigenvalues here don’t correspond to variance explained. Rather, it’s the product of variance explained and Moran’s I of the eigenvector. The eigenvalue drops sharply from PC1 to PC4, then levels off after PC7. The most negative eigenvalue is about -2 and the absolute value drops sharply in the next most negative eigenvalue. Given the magnitude of the eigenvalue, the most negative eigenvector might be interesting, as the Voyager MERFISH vignette hints at the presence of negative spatial autocorrelation in this dataset at the cellular level, as Moran’s I for total transcript counts per cell is somewhat negative, at around -0.1, which might not be weak given that the lower bound of Moran’s I given the spatial neighborhood graph is usually closer to -0.5 than -1, while the upper bound is usually approximately 1.\nAlso note that spatial autocorrelation in datasets with single cell resolution should be interpreted differently from that in Visium which does not have single cell resolution, because of different length scales. In a geographical analogy, this is just like comparing houses as opposed to comparing neighborhoods, or comparing cities as opposed to comparing states.\nThen we compare the eigenvectors, allowing for flipping (i.e. multiplied by -1), which is OK, because an eigenvector multiplied by a scalar is still an eigenvector of the same matrix with the same eigenvalue.\n\nplot_pc_diffs <- function(mat1, mat2, npcs = 30, tail = FALSE, title = NULL) {\n    diffs <- numeric(npcs)\n    if (tail) {\n        ind1 <- tail(seq_len(ncol(mat1)), npcs)\n        ind2 <- tail(seq_len(ncol(mat2)), npcs)\n    } else {\n        ind1 <- ind2 <- seq_len(npcs)\n    }\n    for (i in seq_len(npcs)) {\n        pc1 <- mat1[,ind1[i]]\n        pc2 <- mat2[,ind2[i]]\n        diffs[i] <- min(mean(abs(pc1 - pc2)), mean(abs(pc1 + pc2))) # flipped\n    }\n    tibble(difference = diffs,\n           PC = seq_len(npcs)) |> \n        ggplot(aes(PC, difference)) +\n        geom_line() +\n        geom_hline(yintercept = sqrt(.Machine$double.eps), linetype = 2) +\n        scale_y_log10() +\n        scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::breaks_width(5)) +\n        annotation_logticks(sides = \"l\") +\n        labs(title = title, y = \"Mean absolute difference\")\n}\n\nCompare the eigenvectors with positive eigenvalues:\n\nplot_pc_diffs(attr(rsp_res, \"rotation\"), attr(ade_res, \"rotation\"),\n              title = \"Differences in eigenvectors, adespatial vs. RSpectra, positive\")\n\n\n\n\nCompare the eigenvectors with negative eigenvalues:\n\nplot_pc_diffs(attr(rsp_res, \"rotation\"), attr(ade_res, \"rotation\"), tail = TRUE,\n              title = \"Differences in eigenvectors, adespatial vs. RSpectra, negative\")\n\n\n\n\nThe differences are well below epsilon for all 30 PCs on both ends of the spectrum, mostly below 1e-14, i.e. can be accounted for by machine precision (the dashed line around 1.5e-8). The difference somewhat increases for eigenvalues with smaller absolute values, but still well below epsilon.\nCompare the cell embeddings, first for positive eigenvalues: In theory, because the eigenvectors are the same (allowing for flipping) and the embeddings are found by the dot product of the gene expression profile of each cell with each PC, the embeddings should be the same. However, I’m plotting the differences here just in case adespatial does something extra behind the scene.\n\nplot_pc_diffs(rsp_res, ade_res,\n              title = \"Differences in embeddings, adespatial vs. RSpectra, positive\")\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_pc_diffs(rsp_res, ade_res, tail = TRUE,\n              title = \"Differences in embeddings, adespatial vs. RSpectra, negative\")\n\n\n\n\nThe embeddings are also well below epsilon and the differences have the same patterns as those of eigenvectors, so adespatial simply computed the dot product without doing anything else. So in conclusion, my RSpectra implementation gives consistent results as the adespatial implementation but 80 times faster without optimized BLAS and 4 times faster with optimized BLAS.\nThat said, the adespatial implementation allows for different column and row weighting for other types of duality diagram multivariate analyses. For now, I’m only concerned with PCA, so my implementation is simplified.\n\n\nBenchmark\nSince the default is non-optimized BLAS and those using a server most likely can’t change the BLAS, I perform the benchmark without optimized BLAS. I use different sized bounding boxes to spatially subset the data and compare the time and memory usage of the two implementations of MULTISPATI, with 30 most positive and 30 most negative eigenvalues. This dataset has 385 genes, which should not make this benchmark irrelevant because in spatial transcriptomics, the datasets with the most cells come from smFISH based methods such as MERFISH, which typically have a few hundred curated genes. Transcriptome wide datasets with hundreds of thousands of cells or spots are less common, but with subcellular NGS based methods such as PIXEL-seq and Stereo-seq, these datasets may be coming. MULTISPATI is a spatial method.\nHere I get the sizes of boxes spanning orders of magnitude, to get a wide range of numbers of cells:\n\n(diffs <- 2^seq(7, 13, length.out = 7))\n\n[1]  128  256  512 1024 2048 4096 8192\n\n\nHere I run the benchmark using the different sized subsets. I’m not checking if the results match here as is default in bench::mark(), because I have already checked, and because the eigenvectors can be flipped so the comparison is more involved than all.equal(). Both time and memory usage are recorded.\n\nbenchmark_multispati <- function(sfe, diff) {\n    xmin <- 3000\n    ymin <- 3000\n    bbox <- st_as_sfc(st_bbox(c(xmin = xmin, ymin = ymin, \n                                xmax = xmin + diff, ymax = ymin + diff)))\n    inds <- st_intersects(centroids(sfe), bbox, sparse = FALSE)\n    sfe_sub <- sfe[,inds]\n    colGraph(sfe_sub, \"knn\") <- findSpatialNeighbors(sfe_sub, method = \"knearneigh\",\n                                                     k = 5, dist_type = \"idw\", \n                                                     style = \"W\")\n    df <- bench::mark(adespatial = calc_multispati_ade(sfe_sub, \"knn\"),\n                      rspectra = calc_multispati_rspectra(sfe_sub, \"knn\"),\n                      max_iterations = 1, check = FALSE)\n    df$ncells <- ncol(sfe_sub)\n    df\n}\n\nReformat the results for plotting:\n\nif (!file.exists(\"benchmark_res.rds\")) {\n    benchmark_res <- map_dfr(diffs, benchmark_multispati, sfe = sfe)\n    benchmark_res <- benchmark_res |> \n        mutate(expression = as.character(expression),\n               mem_alloc = as.numeric(mem_alloc)/(1024^2))\n    saveRDS(benchmark_res, \"benchmark_res.rds\")\n} else {\n    benchmark_res <- readRDS(\"benchmark_res.rds\")\n}\n\n\n# Get colorblind friendly palette\ndata(\"ditto_colors\")\n\nHere I plot the time taken vs. the number of cells for both implementations:\n\nggplot(benchmark_res, aes(ncells, total_time, color = expression)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    scale_x_log10() +\n    annotation_logticks() +\n    labs(x = \"Number of cells\", y = \"Time\", color = \"Implementation\") +\n    scale_color_manual(values = ditto_colors)\n\n\n\n\nWhen run non-interactively in this benchmark, both implementations were much faster than the initial profiles above. But RSpectra is overall an order of magnitude faster than adespatial, though the gap shrinks with increasing number of cells, from over 20 times faster at around 100 cells to about 7 times faster at over 200,000 cells. For 200,000 cells, adespatial took 50 seconds when run non-interactively, while RSpectra took 7.79 seconds.\nAlso plot memory usage vs. number of cells:\n\nggplot(benchmark_res, aes(ncells, mem_alloc, color = expression)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    scale_x_log10() +\n    scale_y_log10(breaks = scales::breaks_log()) +\n    annotation_logticks() +\n    labs(x = \"Number of cells\", y = \"Memory (MB)\", color = \"Implementation\") +\n    scale_color_manual(values = ditto_colors)\n\n\n\n\nRSpectra also uses about 7 times less memory than adespatial across different number of cells. For the largest subset, with over 200,000 cells, adespatial used 36 GB of RAM, while RSpectra used about 5.2 GB, so while the latter can be run on my laptop, the former cannot.\nSo the RSpectra implementation of MULTISPATI looks promising. It will be added to Voyager for the Bioconductor 3.17 release. In addition, I should modify the PCA-related plotting functions in Voyager to improve user experiences around negative eigenvalues. In the sequel of this post, I’ll apply the now more scalable MULTISPATI PCA to the entire dataset with nearly 400,000 cells and try to do some biological interpretations.\n\n\nSession

I miss starship Voyager1 and its awesome voyages in geographical space, and if it can think it probably also misses me Captain Lambda Janeway. Because I spent my time turning geospatial ideas from starship Voyager into new features in R package Voyager, which I’m announcing here.\nIn addition, we are getting more like the USS Voyager crew in Star Trek – we now have a team working on this project after the first release. While I’m still pretty much the only author of the code, the team made awesome contributions to the vignettes and documentation website.\nYou can install the new release from Bioconductor, and note that R 4.3 is required:\nThis will also install SpatialFeatureExperiment (SFE), an S4 class that brings Simple Feature to SpatialExperiment and SingleCellExperiment (SCE). Voyager to SFE is just like scater and scran to SCE and Seurat to SeuratObject, performing exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and data visualization based on the data structure SFE. The SFEData package is for example datasets used extensively in Voyager’s vignettes, code examples, and some unit tests.\nFirst load the packages used to demonstrate the new features; all of these packages are imported or suggested by Voyager unless noted otherwise.\nThe mouse skeletal muscle Visium dataset from (McKellar et al. 2021) is used to demonstrate the new features:"

However, note that doing so can change color perception of the palette that colors the geometries. For example, we can plot the image when plotting gene expression just like in Seurat, although I personally don’t like using a divergent palette as in Seurat while the variable plotted does not have a meaningful divergence. The argument image_id must be specified to plot an image.\n\nplotSpatialFeature(sfe, c(\"Myh2\", \"Ftl1\"), image_id = \"lowres\", maxcell = 5e4,\n                   swap_rownames = \"symbol\")\n\n\n\n\nThe maxcell argument is the maximum of pixels to plot in the image; if the image has more pixels than this then it will be downsampled to speed up plotting. A lower number is recommended when plotting many genes in multiple panels because a lower resolution is sufficient for the small size of the panels.\nPlot the image with dimension reduction:\n\nspatialReducedDim(sfe, \"multispati\", ncomponents = 2, image_id = \"lowres\",\n                  maxcell = 5e4, divergent = TRUE, diverge_center = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\nplotGeometry()\nOr just plot the geometries without coloring.

In the dark theme, higher values have lighter color as if glowing, and in divergent palettes, the diverge center has a dark color to emphasize values away from the center.\nHere we plot a gene from the MERFISH dataset, with light theme:\n\nplotSpatialFeature(sfe_mer, \"Aldh3a2\", colGeometryName = \"cellSeg\",\n                   image_id = \"PolyT\", exprs_values = \"counts\", \n                   alpha = 0.7) # though the cells are covered up\n\n\n\n\nThe darker color for higher value gets harder to see with the dark image background. Here’s the dark theme:\n\nplotSpatialFeature(sfe_mer, \"Aldh3a2\", colGeometryName = \"cellSeg\",\n                   image_id = \"PolyT\", exprs_values = \"counts\", \n                   alpha = 0.7, dark = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nThe higher values have lighter color so get more emphasized.\nFrom the first release, Voyager can plot a feature associated with a column (cell or Visium spot) geometry and a feature associated with an annotation (e.g. myofibers) geometry simultaneously, with different palettes. While the individual palettes are designed to be colorblind friendly, it’s much more difficult to make the combination of two palettes colorblind friendly, but I tried pick palettes to distinct colors so they are less likely to get mixed up. The light theme has 2 default linear palettes, one for the column geometries and one for annotation geometries and 2 divergent palettes. The dark theme also has 2 default linear palettes and 2 divergent palettes, chosen from the scico package. In divergent palettes, warm colors denote values higher than the center, and cool colors denote values lower than the center. Here we use the two palettes on light and dark theme:\n\np1 <- plotSpatialFeature(sfe, \"Myh2\", colGeometryName = \"spotPoly\", \n                         annotGeometryName = \"myofiber_simplified\", \n                         annot_aes = list(fill = \"area\"), \n                         aes_use = \"color\", # plot empty circles to not to cover\n                         fill = NA, swap_rownames = \"symbol\", linewidth = 0.5)\np2 <- plotSpatialFeature(sfe, \"Myh2\", colGeometryName = \"spotPoly\", \n                         annotGeometryName = \"myofiber_simplified\", \n                         annot_aes = list(fill = \"area\"), aes_use = \"color\",\n                         fill = NA, swap_rownames = \"symbol\", linewidth = 0.5,\n                         dark = TRUE)\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\nAlso to show the divergent palettes; the myofiber areas don’t have meaninful divergence, but a divergent palette is used just to show both divergent palettes. Whether to use divergent palette needs to be set separately for colGeometry and annotGeometry, because as in this case, one can have meaningful divergence while the other does not.\n\narea_median <- median(annotGeometry(sfe, \"myofiber_simplified\")$area)\np1 <- spatialReducedDim(sfe, \"multispati\", components = 2, \n                        colGeometryName = \"spotPoly\",\n                        annotGeometryName = \"myofiber_simplified\", \n                        annot_aes = list(fill = \"area\"), aes_use = \"color\",\n                        fill = NA, swap_rownames = \"symbol\", linewidth = 0.5,\n                        divergent = TRUE, diverge_center = 0,\n                        annot_divergent = TRUE, \n                        annot_diverge_center = area_median)\np2 <- spatialReducedDim(sfe, \"multispati\", components = 2, \n                        colGeometryName = \"spotPoly\",\n                        annotGeometryName = \"myofiber_simplified\", \n                        annot_aes = list(fill = \"area\"), aes_use = \"color\",\n                        fill = NA, swap_rownames = \"symbol\", linewidth = 0.5,\n                        divergent = TRUE, diverge_center = 0,\n                        annot_divergent = TRUE, \n                        annot_diverge_center = area_median,\n                        dark = TRUE)\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\nAgain, just like when plotting the image behind the geometries, plotting with two color palettes can distort color perception of either palette and can result into colors from different palettes that are hard to tell apart, so use with caution."

It’s better to perform the analysis on Ensembl IDs because they more unambiguously refer to a certain genomic region than gene symbols. Furthermore, gene symbols often have alises. However, it would be nice to show the more human readable gene symbols on plots.\nIn version 1.2.0, we introduced the swap_rownames argument, to be consistent with scater’s plotting functions, whenever one may wish to use gene symbols to query data while the underlying data has Ensembl IDs. This includes localResult() getters in SFE, calculateUnivariate(), runUnivariate(), calculateBivariate(), runBivariate(), all plotting functions that can plot gene information, and plotting functions of spatial analysis results of gene expression. This is already used in the sections above.\nIn the previous release, whether to show gene symbol was indicated by the show_symbol argument and the column in rowData(sfe) for gene symbols is assumed to be named “symbol”. Now show_symbol is deprecated, as swap_rownames allows any name of the symbol column and makes it explicit when gene symbols are plotted while the data uses Ensembl IDs. A warning is issued when a gene symbol matches multiple Ensembl IDs.\nIn addition, calculateUnivariate() and calculateBivariate() can return gene symbols in the results with swap_rownames specified even if the input features argument is Ensembl IDs."

Doing so will overwrite the existing results with different parameters.\nIn this release, we allow users to specify the name under which to store the results, with the name argument in runUnivariate() and runBivariate() so results from the same method but different parameters can coexist in the same SFE object. The standard name is used by default.\nIn addition, the parameters are stored and checked the next time the same method is run. There’s the argument overwrite, to indicate whether to overwrite existing results when the new results were generated from different parameters. If overwrite = FALSE, then runUnivariate() or runBivariate() will throw an error when there’s existing results under the same name but with different parameters.

However, spdep’s distance based edge weights is very inefficient, because spdep does not keep the distance among neighbors returned by dbscan (which is very efficient) when computing k nearest or distance based neighbors, so when computing the edge weights, spdep has to call st_distance() to re-compute the distances, which can be very time consuming.\nIn SpatialFeatureExperiment 1.2.0, we use BiocNeighbors to find k nearnest and distance based neighbors, which has a uniform user interface for multiple neighbor finding algorithms such as Annoy, Hnsw, and etc. We also keep the distances returned by BiocNeighbors to calculate distance based edge weights.

Multivariate methods also have a uniform user interface in calculateMultivariate() to directly return the results, and runMultivariate() to store the results in reducedDims(sfe), or if applicable, colData(sfe).\nHere we run MULTISPATI PCA with 20 positive and 20 negative eigenvalues on highly variable genes:\n\nhvgs <- getTopHVGs(sfe, n = 1000)\n\n\nsfe <- runMultivariate(sfe, \"multispati\", nfposi = 20, nfnega = 20,\n                       subset_row = hvgs)\n\nPlot the eigenvalues: The ElbowPlot() function has been updated to plot negative eigenvalues which signify negative spatial autocorrelation and to color and facet when a spatial dimension reduction is run on different samples (i.e. tissue sections) separately.\n\nElbowPlot(sfe, ndims = 20, nfnega = 20, reduction = \"multispati\")\n\n\n\n\nPlot projections of Visium spot gene expression profiles into each MULTISPATI PC:\n\nspatialReducedDim(sfe, \"multispati\", 2, divergent = TRUE, diverge_center = 0)\n\n\n\n\nSee the MULTISPATI vignette for an intro to MULTISPATI PCA and more in depth discussions. Voyager has an implementation of MULTISPATI PCA based on RSpectra that is much faster than the original implementation in adespatial, to meet the demands to analyze larger spatial -omics data. It is efficient enough to be performed on over 390,000 cells in the MERFISH dataset shown in the MULTISPATI vignette. See benchmark here.\nRelated to MULTISPATI PCA is moranBounds(), which is a more efficient implementation of adespatial::moran.bounds() to find the upper and lower bounds of Moran’s I given a spatial neighborhood graph. Basically it diagonalizes the double centered adjacency matrix of the graph. However, because the double centered matrix is dense, this can take a lot of memory for larger datasets. Here we find the Moran bounds for this Visium dataset:\n\n(mb <- moranBounds(colGraph(sfe, \"visium\")))\n\n      Imin       Imax \n-0.5762132  1.0021884 \n\n\nUsually the lower bound is closer to -0.5 than -1, and negative Moran’s I should be interpreted accordingly."

When there is positive spatial autocorrelation, the variogram increases with distance, because spatial autocorrelation reduces variance among nearby locations, until it levels off, showing the distance where spatial autocorrelation no longer has an effect. It can also show spatial autocorrelation in different directions, when there’s anisotropy. The correlogram can also show different length scales of spatial autocorrelation, but it’s not scalable to larger spatial distances.\nHere we demonstrate variogram map on one gene.

It was introduced in 1.2.0. In the first release, the column in rowData(sfe) for gene symbols when the row names are in fact Ensembl is assumed to be “symbol”, and the show_symbol argument is used to show the more human readable gene symbols while everything behind the scene is Ensembl IDs because the latter is more unambiguous. In 1.2.0, the show_symbol argument is deprecated, and any column can be specified in swap_rownames. This is elaborated on in the Miscellaneous section.\n\nplotVariogramMap(sfe, \"Ftl1\", swap_rownames = \"symbol\")\n\n\n\n\nHere the data is scaled by default before computing the variogram so the variograms of different genes are comparable.

I didn’t finish writing this until May because I’ve been busy writing the second release of the R package Voyager and my thesis. Now that I have turned in my thesis, I can finally finish up the Captain’s Logs.\nI had a week of bad sleep, in large part due to the cold storm. I regret not using the heater. It sounds crazy, but many LA apartment buildings have heaters, because the buildings are often not very well-insulated and California law requires that a home must be able to sustain 70 degrees Farenheit in the winter. I have never used the heater because it burns gas and I try not to burn fossil fuels. Usually putting on more clothes would help. Except that I didn’t keep my feet warm enough. I got chilblains back in winter 2020. Basically the blood vessels in my toes vasoconstricted so hard that they broke themselves, so when my feet warm back up, my toes would get really itchy as blood flowed into the broken vessels. It went away, but would come back in subsequent winters, sometimes waking me up at night. While I would try to go to bed earlier, with Frozen Turkey locking myself out of my laptop, I still struggled to fall asleep, even with melatonin, because of my nocturnal circadian rhythm. When I finally fell asleep, I soon woke up from toe itch. As a result, I ended up with poor sleep.\nThe chilblains was gone. Yet I had another night of bad sleep. I knew that I had to get up at 6:30 and leave by around 7 am to get to the 8:30 am ride on time, so I tried to go to bed earlier but nevertheless couldn’t fall asleep until midnight. Initially I slept well, but sometime before 5 am, the siren and some really fast cars woke me up. I don’t know what was happening. It sounded like cops chasing a speeding driver. Or just emergency vehicles going fast for any reason just because the roads were empty. Then I couldn’t fall back asleep no matter what. So another zombie day."

    "text": "San Jose Creek and San Gabriel River\nWe were back at the park. Then what? I originally planned a lot of climbing, to the Turnbull Canyon and Hacienda Heights, but my sleep deprivation caught up with me. I felt like a zombie and didn’t feel like climbing. So I headed straight to San Jose Creek, a tributary of the San Gabriel River, where there’s a bike path, which was after the climbs in my original plan. Again, there was a homeless encampment at the eastern end. I saw a horde of little birds in the river, covered by shallow water from side to side after the storm, and tried to take a photo. However, when I walked closer to get a better spot, the birds noticed and all flew away, so no photo.\n\n\n\nAt the east end of the San Jose Creek bike path\n\n\n\n\n\nHomeless encampment at the east end of San Jose Creek, which is fully lined with concrete\n\n\nI have ridden the full length of the San Gabriel River bike path from Azusa to Seal Beach (though not in one single trip), and have ridden as much of the LA River bike paths as possible from Canoga Park to Glendale Narrows to Maywood to Long Beach. I have also seen much of upstream parts in the Angeles National Forest. so I have seen a lot of the two great rivers of LA County. Overall, the San Gabriel River is much less clad in concrete as LA River. Arguably Santa Clara River north of the San Gabriel Mountains is a third great river of LA County. Santa Ana River could be another as it’s culturally relevant to the Tongva further to the east, although its watershed is almost all outside LA County. The arbitrary straight borders of LA County don’t make cultural and geographical sense.\nDue to the great 1938 flood, the LA River was channelized for flood control, which was completed in 1960. Among all of LA River and its tributaries downstream of the foothill dams (e.g. Hansen Dam for Tujunga Wash, Devil’s Gate Dam for Arroyo Seco, Pacoima Reservoir for Pacoima Wash) I have visited, it’s almost all concrete, except for Sepulveda Basin, Glendale Narrows, Long Beach estuary where LA River empties into the ocean for the main LA River, a little stretch downstream of the Devil’s Gate Dam and a little beneath Colorado St Bridge for Arroyo Seco, a little bit of Compton Wash, and the Peck Rd Water Conservation Area and when entering the Whittier Narrows Dam for Rio Hondo.\nIn contrast, San Gabriel River is not channelized upstream of Rio San Gabriel Park in Downey, already downstream of Whittier Narrows, though it does have concrete banks to prevent it from changing course. As a result, I find the ride down San Gabriel River all the way to Seal Beach more interesting than the ride down Rio Hondo and LA River to Long Beach. I wonder if it’s because the Cogswell, San Gabriel, Morris, and Santa Fe Dams already do a good job for flood control upstream so more channelization is unnecessary, or the San Gabriel River watershed was less populated than the LA River watershed, or the San Gabriel River tends not to flood as badly as LA River. Nevertheless, the concrete channels of LA River can attract many birds and get quite interesting. Graffiti also livens up the concrete. I don’t know nearly as much about tributaries of the San Gabriel River south of Santa Fe Dam simply because they are too far east for me to visit very often.\n\n\n\nThe part of San Jose Creek where the concrete ended, which looks kind of like Glendale Narrows of LA River.\n\n\nBut this part of San Jose Creek was concrete. The concrete bottom soon ended, making the river look so much like the Glendale Narrows. Spatial statistics lesson: the importance of spatially structured covariates. This part of San Jose Creek is not connected to the Glendale Narrows, but they look similar because of the interaction between similar climates, landscapes, and riparian ecosystems. The bike paths add to the similarity. The similar climates and landscapes must interact with being rivers to create the similar looks. This is what creates the spatial autocorrelation in the river appearance. But how would I know had I not known the covariates? Suppose I partition LA into pixels and perform univariate spatial analyses for all variables I can think of. The variables for river ecosystems would show local negative spatial autocorrelation and high local spatial heteroscedasticity because the built communities on the banks of the rivers are very different from the river itself. However, if we compute Moran’s I only for the rivers, the results would be very different.\nMoral for histological space: I don’t think we can capture all relevant covariates from transcriptomics. Such covariates might be better captured by studying the extracellular matrix, metabolomics, proteomics, and etc. But sometimes we can get covariates from transcriptomics. Perhaps well-established cell type marker genes cab be used as covariates. For example, markers for blood vessels can be thought of as akin to marking which areas are rivers. What if we perform spatial analysis on different cell types separately, especially for the very distinctive ones like blood vessels? Now we have spatial transcriptomics datasets covering large tissue areas, with hundreds of thousands of cells. What are the length scales of spatial autocorrelation for genes, computed separately for very distinctive cell types? How do say blood vessels differ within the vast tissue section?\nIt’s somewhat like comparing rivers in SoCal. As of writing, I have already returned from the Green Fondo in Santa Barbara County. The Santa Ynez River, at least the parts I visited, was not channelized. Morphologically, and in terms of some of the plant species, it looks a lot like some of the upstream, unchannelized parts of Pacoima Wash, Big Tujunga Wash, Santa Clara River, San Gabriel River a little upstream of the San Gabriel Reservoir, some of modern Arroyo Seco, and some of Arroyo Seco and LA River in historical photos prior to channelization. But surely there are differences among those rivers. For example, the steep grades of the San Gabriel River washing rocks down gave rise to the Irwindale gravel pits, whose rocks were used to build many LA landmarks, and the Prado region of the Santa Ana River has distinctive clay used by Indigenous people for pottery. While I did see the familiar oak groves, California poppies, arroyo lupines, and invasive mustard that I also see in LA during Green Fondo, I saw a lot of small yellow flowers that I did not see in LA. The geomorphology there is also quite different from that of LA south of the San Gabriel River, but it’s more reminiscent of Soledad Canyon and Ojai. Now I wish that I were a geologist.\n\n\n\nLooking back from the west end of the San Jose Creek bike path\n\n\nOK, that’s it for my digression in thought. There’s a dirt trail the other side of San Jose Creek, apparently for equestrians, as I saw horses there. From what I heard from mountain bikers, horses and bikes don’t mix very well. After this little stretch of bike path by the San Jose Creek, I braved some traffic and got to the San Gabriel River bike path, where I saw two guys riding time trisl bikes. The river, not channelized, looked like a lake. The unusually high water submerged many of the trees I used to see in the more wetland-like parts when there was less water. I exited the bike path at Valley Blvd, at the railroad bridge full of graffiti, which is a Pacific Electric relic. I saw a cyclist with a child trailer on Valley Blvd from beneath the road; it could have been a great photo, but I missed it.\n\n\n\nThis part of the San Gabriel River is not lined with concrete. After the storm it looked like a lake, so weird by LA standards.\n\n\n\n\n\nGraffiti railroad bridge crossing the San Gabriel River a little north of Valley Blvd"

    "text": "El Monte\nI took Valley Blvd to downtown El Monte, to check out some public art at the Metrolink and Metro Silver Line stations. The public art at the Metrolink station has a very interesting back story. In brief, the Whittier Narrows area has a Hollywood heritage. There were lion farms and jungle movies were shot in this region. The public art commemorates this forgotten heritage. Though I’m sure that PETA is so glad that it’s no longer there, since I’m sure that lion farms aren’t very humane.\n\n\n\nDowntown El Monte, entering Main St from Ramona Blvd\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic art at El Monte Metrolink Station.\n\n\nAlso to revisit the Main St mall, with murals sponsored by the new fast fashion company Shein. Those are good murals, though I’m not a fan of fast fashion in general because it’s inherently unsustainable. I proudly wear clothes that are over 10 years old. I bought a second hand Pearl Izumi long sleeve jersey for more casual rides; based on the style of the Pearl Izumi logo and that it was made in the US, I guess it was probably made in the 1980s or 1990s, so it’s probably older than I am and must be full of stories I most likely never get to hear. It might not be specifically made for women though it was small enough to fit me. Also consistent with its age, it stinks pretty easily while my 2020s jersies have modern odor resistant tech.\n\n\n\nOne of the Shein murals. Note that Main St was not very prosperous as many shops there were closed.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic art at El Monte Silver Line station. One more reason why transit rocks!"

    "text": "Rio Hondo\nIt turns out that, unlike on Strava’s map, I actually could direct access the Rio Hondo bike path from the Silver Line station. Rio Hondo was covered side to side with water, and that’s a lot of water by LA standards. Normally the river was mostly dry so we could walk in it, with water only in the narrow central ditch and maybe a little bit beyond. So I almost forgot that in many other parts of the world, rivers can be so large that they can carry ships.\n\n\n\nOn Rio Hondo\n\n\n\n\n\nA man riding on the sloped concrete bank of Rio Hondo\n\n\n\n\n\nAs he approached the Arcadia Wash confluence that disruped the sloped bank, he had to dismount and walk into the river.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe continued riding into Arcadia Wash\n\n\nI saw a man riding a bike on the concrete bank. I rode faster than he did so I could dial in camera settings and take photos of him when he caught up. The sloped concrete bank was interrupted by the Arcadia Wash, so he had to dismount and walk into the river, which wasn’t deep. Then he continued riding on the river bed into Arcadia Wash. I wonder how he could get out as the river bank was perpendicular to the ground.\n\n\n\nThe San Gabriel Valley Airport\n\n\n\n\n\nAn airplane about to land\n\n\nThe mountains were shrouded in cloud, but a little bit of the snowy peaks peeked out. It was unusual to see so much snow, after the cold February storm. An airplane was landing at the San Gabriel Valley Airport. I know that I can see Mt San Antonio from here, but it was hidden behind clouds.\n\n\n\nThe submerged bike path\n\n\n\n\n\nMap of LA River and San Gabriel River at the park\n\n\n\n\n\nSnowy peak peeking out of the cloud, from the Peck Rd park\n\n\nPeck Rd Water Conservation Area is a reservoir where the Sawpit Wash and Santa Anita Wash meet and form Rio Hondo. There’s a bike path south of the lake, which was flooded. So I rode into the park, just to take a look since it’s been a while since I last visited. There was a map of LA and San Gabriel Rivers etched on the ground. I stood in such a way that my shadow pointed to Peck Rd Water Conservation Area.\nBecause that part of the bike path was flooded, I had to exit the park on Peck Rd, braving the traffic, before I turned left on Live Oak Ave, where I crossed Foss Ave. Yep, join us now and share that software, you’ll be free hackers, you’ll be free. I mean Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). After that, I went on Longden, standard route returning from the eastern part of the SGV."
